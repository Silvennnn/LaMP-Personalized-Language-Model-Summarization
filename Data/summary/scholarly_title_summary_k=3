411927	41192755	Analyzing Privacy Policies at Scale: From Crowdsourcing to Automated Annotations.	Website privacy policies are often long and complex, making it difficult for users to understand their privacy rights. Despite the fact that research shows Internet users care about their privacy, most people do not have the time or inclination to read through every website's privacy policy. To address this issue, efforts have been made to use crowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies and provide users with important information. However, there has been little research on the accuracy of these methods or how to improve productivity. This article discusses the progress made in these areas, including analyzing crowdworker performance, a method to simplify the task, and approaches to identify specific user choices in privacy policies. These efforts demonstrate the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods to extract important details from privacy policies for the benefit of Internet users.
411928	4119288	BML and Related Tools	The Bytecode Modeling Language (BML) is a language used for specifying properties in Java bytecode. It allows for a high level of abstraction without restricting the format of the bytecode. BML specifications can be stored in class files, making it useful for proof-carrying code frameworks. BML is also similar to the source code level language JML, allowing for easy translation of specifications and proofs. This paper explains the BML language and its binary representation, as well as the available tools for working with BML. These tools include BMLLib, Umbra, JML2BML, BML2BPL, and CCT, which allow for inspecting, editing, and generating proofs for BML specifications. 
411928	41192849	Extending JML Specifications with Temporal Logic	This paper introduces a proposed extension of the Java Modeling Language (JML) that includes temporal specifications. The inspiration for this extension comes from the Bandera project and is specifically designed for Java(Card) programs. This extension allows for the specification of exceptional behavior in methods and has been designed to be user-friendly for software engineers. An example is provided to demonstrate how the JML extension can be used to specify temporal aspects of the JavaCard API. The paper also discusses the semantics of the extension and provides a way to translate it into standard JML for the purpose of re-using existing verification techniques. A trace-based semantics is given for the new features of the language.
411928	41192833	Procedure-modular specification and verification of temporal safety properties	ProMoVer is a tool that automates the verification process for Java programs with method-local and global assertions. It uses modular verification, where global properties are checked based on local properties rather than implementation details. This is achieved by constructing maximal models that abstract away from program data. ProMoVer supports both linear-time temporal logic and finite automata for specifying safety properties and has a mechanism for proof reuse to minimize verification tasks. It also supports abstraction from private methods and automatic extraction of candidate specifications from method implementations. The tool has been evaluated on various Java applications and has shown promising results.
411929	41192963	Inapproximability Results for Guarding Polygons and Terrains	Past research on art gallery problems has focused on finding the minimum number of guards needed in various situations. However, there is limited research on the complexity of these problems. This paper examines the approximability of three types of art gallery problems - VERTEX GUARD, EDGE GUARD, and POINT GUARD - motivated by a practical problem. The authors prove that for polygons without holes, these problems cannot be approximated by a polynomial time algorithm with a ratio of 1 + δ. For polygons with holes, the problems cannot be approximated by a polynomial time algorithm with a ratio of ((1 − ε)/12) ln n, unless NP ⊆ TIME(n O(log log n)). The inapproximability of the POINT GUARD problem for polygons with holes also applies to the problem of covering a 2.5-dimensional terrain with guards at a fixed height above the terrain or on the terrain itself.
411929	41192923	Optimum Inapproximability Results for Finding Minimum Hidden Guard Sets in Polygons and Terrains	The Minimum Hidden Guard Set problem involves placing the fewest possible guards in a given polygon or terrain so that no two guards can see each other and every point in the area is visible from at least one guard. This problem has been shown to be difficult to approximate, as it cannot be approximated by a polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation ratio of n1-驴 for any 驴 0, unless NP = P. This result holds even for polygons without holes, which distinguishes it from other visibility problems. Additionally, an approximation algorithm with a ratio of n is the best possible for this problem.
411929	41192956	How Many People Can Hide in a Terrain?	This paper explores the problem of determining the maximum number of people that can be hidden in a given terrain without being seen by each other. The authors show that this problem is difficult to solve, with an approximation ratio that is almost as hard as the Maximum Clique problem. This means that it cannot be approximated by any polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation ratio of nƐ for some small positive number Ɛ, unless P = NP. Even for a simple polygon without holes, the problem cannot be approximated with an approximation ratio of 1 + Ɛ, where Ɛ is a constant.
411930	411930106	Inapproximability Results for Guarding Polygons and Terrains	Past research on art gallery problems has focused primarily on determining the minimum number of guards needed for worst-case scenarios in different settings. However, there is limited research on the complexity of these problems. This paper aims to fill this gap by studying the approximability of three types of art gallery problems: VERTEX GUARD, EDGE GUARD, and POINT GUARD. The authors show that for input polygons without holes, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation ratio of 1 + δ for these problems. They also prove that for polygons with holes, these problems cannot be approximated with a ratio of ((1-ε)/12) ln n, unless NP is a subset of TIME(n O(log log n)). These results are obtained through gap-preserving reductions from 5-OCCURRENCE-MAX-3-SAT and SET COVER problems. Furthermore, the inapproximability of the POINT GUARD problem for polygons with holes extends to the problem of covering a 2.5-dimensional terrain with a minimum number of guards, even when the guards can be placed on the terrain itself.
411930	41193063	Positioning Guards at Fixed Height Above a Terrain - An Optimum Inapproximability Result	The problem of minimizing the number of guards at a fixed height to ensure complete visibility of all triangles on a 2.5-dimensional terrain is studied. It is proven to be NP-hard and cannot be approximated within a certain ratio by a polynomial time algorithm, unless a specific condition is met. This condition depends on the number of triangles in the terrain. An approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio of ln n+1 exists, making this result close to the best possible hardness for this problem.
411930	4119308	Improved bounds for the conflict-free chromatic art gallery problem	The art gallery problem involves guarding simple polygons with point guards assigned different colors. The conflict-free chromatic art gallery problem aims to cover the polygon with guards in a way that each point is seen by a guard with a unique color. The minimum number of colors needed for this type of covering is denoted as k(n). For orthogonal and monotone polygons, k(n) is known to be O(log n), while for arbitrary simple polygons it is O(log2 n). In this paper, a new upper bound of O(log n) is proposed for simple polygons through a partitioning technique called window partitioning. The concept of independence is also introduced to allow for the reuse of colors in subpolygons. This leads to an overall improvement in the upper bound for arbitrary simple polygons.
411931	41193186	Towards an integration of Golog and planning	Golog, an action language, has been successfully used for controlling robots. Its main advantage is the flexibility in writing programs that can constrain the search for an executable plan. However, when it comes to general planning, Golog falls short compared to modern planners. To address this issue, this paper proposes an integration of Golog and planning, where planning problems are solved by a modern planner during program execution. The focus is on the ADL subset of the plan language PDDL, which is shown to be correctly embedded within Golog. A comparison of the performance of Golog with an integrated ADL planner is also presented.
411931	41193139	On the Relative Expressiveness of ADL and Golog: The Last Piece in the Puzzle	Integrating agent programming languages and efficient action planning is a promising approach that combines the expressive power of languages like Golog with the ability to search for plans efficiently. To integrate a Golog interpreter with a planner, it is important to understand which aspects of Golog can be captured by the planning language. Using Nebel's compilation framework, a maximal fragment of basic action theories, the formalism underlying Golog, is identified as being equivalent to the ADL subset of PDDL. However, it is found that most features that allow for specifying incomplete information in basic action theories cannot be compiled to ADL.
411931	41193195	Expressiveness of ADL and golog: functions make a difference	The focus in action languages like GOLOG was on expressive power, while action planning was focused on efficient plan generation. Combining the two would bring many benefits, allowing a user to control a system's behavior on a high level with GOLOG while using a planning system for low-level actions. Eyerich et al. began integrating GOLOG and planning languages by identifying a subset of the situation calculus (the basis of GOLOG) with the same expressiveness as the ADL fragment of PDDL. However, it was not proven to be the maximum subset, with the most significant restriction being limited functions to constants. Further research shows this restriction is necessary in most cases. 
411932	41193246	A Formal Framework for On-line Software Version Change	Traditional methods of updating software involve shutting down the current version and installing the new one, causing a delay in service for users. However, an on-line software replacement system allows for updates to be made while the program is running, avoiding the need for a shutdown. While there have been various examples of this system in practice, there has been little research on its theoretical aspects. This paper presents a formal framework for studying on-line software version change, including a definition of validity and conditions for ensuring it in a procedural language. It is found that determining validity is generally impossible, but certain conditions can guarantee it.
411932	41193236	On line software version change using state transfer between processes	Traditional software updates require the program to be shut down before the new version can be installed, causing inconvenience and service downtime for users. An on-line software replacement system allows for seamless updates by replacing parts of the software while it is still running. The system described in this paper specifically focuses on implementing this for software written in C. When the user initiates the update, a new process with the new version is created and the state is transferred from the old process at the appropriate time. This results in minimal delay for the user during the switch to the updated version.
411932	41193250	Analytic models for the primary site approach to fault-tolerance	The primary site approach is a common method for ensuring fault tolerance against node failures. It involves replicating the service on multiple nodes, with one designated as the primary and the others as backups. All requests are directed to the primary, which periodically checkpoints its state on the backups. If the primary fails, a backup takes over and re-executes all previous requests since the last checkpoint to maintain consistency. Two important factors that affect the performance of this approach are the checkpointing frequency and the degree of replication. Decreasing the checkpointing interval reduces the overhead for re-executing old requests but increases the overhead for checkpointing. Increasing the degree of replication improves availability but also increases checkpointing time. An analytic model and queuing model are presented to determine the optimal checkpointing interval and degree of replication for a primary site system. The reliability of such a system is also studied.
411933	4119330	Topological map: an efficient tool to compute incrementally topological features on 3d images	This paper discusses the use of a three dimensional topological map to efficiently compute topological features on objects in a 3D image. These features have practical applications in image processing and computer vision. The topological map is a combinatorial model that represents both topological and geometrical information of a labeled 3D image. It can be constructed incrementally using only two operations, and in this study, the authors demonstrate how the Euler characteristic can also be computed incrementally during this process. This opens up possibilities for efficiently computing other features using this model.
411933	41193343	First results for 3D image segmentation with topological map	This paper introduces a new segmentation operation within the 3D topological map framework. The authors demonstrate how a traditional segmentation algorithm can be applied to a 3D image represented by a topological map, and the consistency of the results despite modifications to the algorithm. The complexity of the operation is also studied. Experimental results on 3D medical images are presented, showing the duration of the process and validating the use of 3D topological maps in image processing. Overall, this paper highlights the potential benefits of utilizing 3D topological maps in image segmentation.
411933	41193319	Comparison of local and global region merging in the topological map	The topological map is a model used in image processing to represent 2D and 3D subdivisions. It incorporates both topological and geometrical features to aid in operations like region merging during segmentation. This paper discusses two algorithms for region merging in 3D topological maps: a local one that modifies the map in the vicinity of merged regions, and a global one that traverses the entire map. The complexities of both approaches are analyzed and experimental results are presented to compare their performance. 
411934	41193437	Implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems on a reconfigurable computer	In recent years, there has been a focus on developing reconfigurable computers that combine traditional microprocessors with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These machines have shown promising speed improvements for computationally intensive tasks like codebreaking. However, effectively using and programming these machines remains a challenge. In this study, the researchers demonstrate an efficient implementation of an Elliptic Curve scalar multiplication over GF(2m) using SRC-6E, a leading reconfigurable computer. They discuss how the hardware architecture and programming model influenced their algorithm partitioning strategy. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of control, data transfer, and reconfiguration overheads, as well as a performance comparison with a microprocessor implementation. Overall, this study highlights the potential and challenges of using reconfigurable computers for complex computations.
411934	41193448	An Implementation Comparison of an IDEA Encryption Cryptosystem on Two General-Purpose Reconfigurable Computers	The combination of traditional microprocessors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is emerging as a promising platform for intensive computational computing. It combines the strengths of microprocessors for front-end development and the reconfigurability of FPGAs for solving complex problems. Prototype PC-FPGA machines have shown significant speedups compared to standalone PCs for computationally intensive tasks, making them ideal for cryptographic applications. In this paper, the authors showcase an efficient implementation of IDEA encryption on two leading reconfigurable computers, SRC Computers' SRC-6E and Star Bridge Systems' HC-36. They compare the hardware architecture, programming model, and implementation of IDEA encryption on both platforms, and provide a detailed analysis of FPGA resource utilization, data transfer and reconfiguration overheads for the SRC system, and a comparison with a software implementation.
411934	41193444	ATHENa - Automated Tool for Hardware EvaluatioN: Toward Fair and Comprehensive Benchmarking of Cryptographic Hardware Using FPGAs	Comparing digital system designs for FPGAs is a difficult and time-consuming task that depends on various factors such as algorithms, hardware architecture, implementation techniques, FPGA families, languages and tools. To address this issue, an open-source environment called ATHENa has been introduced for fair, comprehensive, automated, and collaborative hardware benchmarking of algorithms within the same class. The focus of this paper is on benchmarking cryptography algorithms on FPGAs, which have been shown to provide significant speed and security improvements compared to software implementations. The paper demonstrates the capabilities of ATHENa through three examples, including two different architectures for the SHA-256 hash function and one for a candidate for a new standard, Fugue. All necessary codes and files are available on the project website for others to replicate the experiments.
411935	41193543	An n! lower bound on formula size	We have developed a new game, based on the Ehrenfeucht--Fraïssé method, for proving lower bounds on the size of first-order formulas. This game has been used to show that the CTL+ formula Occurn ≡ E[Fp1 ∧ Fp2 ∧ … ∧ Fpn], which states that all n predicates must occur on a path, requires a formula size of n! in CTL. This lower bound is optimal, meaning that no smaller formula can express this property. This result shows that the succinctness of CTL+ compared to CTL is exactly Θ(n)!. We have also used our game to prove an optimal Ω(n) lower bound on the number of boolean variables needed for RLf to polynomially embed CTL+. The number of booleans needed for RL and FO2(TC) is still unknown.
411935	41193545	Dyn-FO: a parallel, dynamic complexity class	Traditionally, computational complexity has focused on static problems, with complexity classes such as NC, P, and NP defined in terms of checking whether an input satisfies a certain property. However, for many computer applications, a dynamic approach is more appropriate. This involves working on a large object over time, with repeated modifications and computations. A new complexity class, dynamic first-order logic (Dyn-FO), has been developed to model this process. It includes problems such as multiplication, graph connectivity, and minimum spanning trees, which were previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of first-order database languages. The concept of "bounded-expansion reductions" is also introduced to honor dynamic complexity classes. While certain standard complete problems for static complexity classes remain complete under these reductions, others, such as REACH for NL and REACH d for L, are no longer complete. Finally, a version of REACH a , called REACH a + , is shown to not be in Dyn-FO unless all of P can be contained in parallel linear time.
411935	41193554	Decidability of inferring inductive invariants.	Induction is a successful method for verifying hardware and software systems. This involves modeling a system with logical formulas and using a decision procedure to confirm the existence of an inductive safety invariant. However, determining the inductive invariant, or invariant inference, is a challenging task often left to humans or abstract interpretation. This paper addresses the problem of inferring first-order inductive invariants by restricting the language of candidate invariants. By defining a well-quasi-order on the state space and restricting the language, the paper shows that inferring invariants can be decidable even when the language is infinite. However, there are some cases where restrictions are necessary and the invariant inference problem is undecidable. The paper also presents a framework for constructing infinite languages while maintaining decidability, and provides examples of decidable invariants for linked-list programs and distributed protocols.
411936	4119368	Framework for Analyzing Garbage Collection	The development of garbage collection algorithms has advanced significantly, but the analysis of these algorithms is still in its early stages. Current analyses only measure the costs of individual executions, and a theoretical foundation is needed to make conclusive statements about the efficiency of garbage collectors across entire programs. This theoretical framework also allows for abstract examination and new designs without concern for implementation details. The proposed framework can accurately compute the time cost of garbage collection over the entire program execution, and has resulted in a new and significantly faster trace generation algorithm called Merlin. The paper also presents a novel result, proving the optimality of Merlin's asymptotic running time for trace generation.
411936	41193612	Nested transactional memory: model and architecture sketches	The article presents a reference model for nested transactions at the memory access level and outlines potential hardware designs to implement it. The model covers both closed and open nesting and focuses on memory access conflicts and the effects of commits and aborts. The hardware designs involve bounded size caches in a processor with overflows to memory. The article also introduces a simpler model called linear nesting, which supports only one thread of execution but may be easier to implement. The model is intended as a target for compiling transactions from source languages, but the mapping process is not discussed in the paper.
411936	41193636	Managing persistent data with Mneme: Designing a reliable, shared object interface	The article discusses the challenges that arise when trying to combine object-oriented languages with database features. It provides guidelines for determining suitable database and language support for design applications, and explores the benefits of integration compared to traditional database systems. The design of Mneme, a system that bridges the gap between object-oriented databases and programming languages, is then discussed. Mneme offers features such as object sharing, reliability, and clustering, as well as flexibility. A comparison with other similar research efforts is made, and the unique contributions of Mneme are described.
411937	41193760	Scalable logo recognition based on compact sparse dictionary for mobile devices	This paper introduces a new logo recognition system that can be used on mobile devices. The system is unsupervised and does not require any supervised training, making it time efficient and low in memory usage. It is also robust against challenging conditions such as noise, different image scales, and rotation. The system uses a segmental quantization approach to generate a compact vocabulary of over one million visual words. This vocabulary is then used to efficiently retrieve logo instances in the dataset through a K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm. The system's vocabulary is significantly smaller than traditional methods, making it suitable for mobile devices. Additionally, a verification method is proposed to filter out false positives. Experiments on a dataset with 400 logo classes demonstrate the system's efficiency and effectiveness.
411937	41193742	Adult Image Detection Combining Bovw Based On Region Of Interest And Color Moments	The authors suggest a new approach to effectively prevent the spread of pornography on the Internet. This method combines bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) and color moments (CM) to detect adult images. BoVW identifies local patterns of adult content by clustering visual words from patches in the whole image, but this can be affected by background noise. The proposed method uses BoVW based on region of interest (ROT) to improve the representative power of visual words, and also adopts a soft-weighting scheme for better detection. CM is added to BoVW based on ROT for further improvement. Experiments show that this method outperforms other techniques currently in use. 
411937	41193744	Fusing audio vocabulary with visual features for pornographic video detection.	Pornographic video detection is an important method for filtering inappropriate content. However, current methods do not accurately represent audio semantics and do not consider the characteristics of pornographic audios. This paper proposes a novel approach that fuses audio vocabulary with visual features for better detection. The approach includes an audio semantics representation method using an energy envelope unit and bag-of-words, a periodicity-based audio segmentation algorithm, and a periodicity-based video decision algorithm. These three aspects work together to utilize the periodicities in pornographic audios. The results of the audio-vocabulary-based and visual-features-based methods are fused using a weighted scheme and a periodicity-based video decision algorithm. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms traditional methods, with a 94.44% true positive rate and a 9.76% false positive rate.
411938	41193851	Causal Behavioural Profiles - Efficient Computation, Applications, and Evaluation	Analysis of behavioural consistency is crucial in software engineering, particularly in process and service management. This involves verifying that behavioural models are consistent with each other, such as a business process model and a workflow model. Existing notions of behaviour equivalence, such as bisimulation and trace equivalence, can be computationally intensive and only provide a Boolean result. To address this, the article proposes the use of causal behavioural profiles, which capture important information about the behaviour of a process model. These profiles are weaker than trace equivalence but can be efficiently computed for a wide range of models. The article also introduces techniques for computing these profiles using structural decomposition techniques and presents findings from applying the technique to three industry model collections.
411938	411938140	Generalised computation of behavioural profiles based on petri-net unfoldings	Behavioural profiles are a way to assess the consistency of process models by describing the relationships between the activities in the model. They are less sensitive to model projections than traditional equivalence criteria. An algorithm has been developed to efficiently derive these profiles for unlabelled, sound free-choice workflow nets. This paper expands on this concept by introducing an algorithm that can derive behavioural profiles from the complete prefix unfolding of a bounded Petri net, making it applicable in a wider range of cases. The concept is also extended to labelled Petri nets, and the approach has been tested on a set of industry models.
411938	411938139	Efficient Consistency Measurement Based on Behavioral Profiles of Process Models	Process-driven business applications require the use of process modeling to bridge the gap between business requirements and system specifications. However, discrepancies in the purpose of business process modeling have made it difficult to align models at different levels and perspectives. This poses a challenge for process modeling. The paper proposes the concept of behavioral profiles to capture the essential constraints of a process model. These profiles can be efficiently computed and used to define a formal notion of consistency. This approach is less sensitive to model projections and allows for measuring deviation in a quantitative way. The authors demonstrate the applicability of this concept through the implementation and testing of their method on the SAP reference model.
411939	41193926	Arity bounds in first-order incremental evaluation and definition of polynomial time database queries	The paper discusses a first-order incremental evaluation system (foies) for database queries that uses a first-order query on the new and old databases, as well as stored auxiliary relations, to derive a new query answer after inserting or deleting a tuple. The paper measures the space needed for foies in terms of the maximal arity of the auxiliary relations and presents results on the existence and nonexistence of space-restricted foies for graph queries. The paper also constructs space efficient foies for these queries and shows that the arity bounds are tight using Ehrenfeucht–Fraı̈ssé games. The paper also considers a variation of foies where the cost of storing the answer is also taken into account and shows that the arity hierarchy remains strict.
411939	4119394	A technique for proving decidability of containment and equivalence of linear constraint queries	This article discusses a new technique that uses counter machines to analyze queries with linear constraints over different types of numbers. It shows that the problems can be solved in exponential space and that there is a lower bound for solving them in exponential time for conjunctive queries. However, for a specific subclass of queries (called SQL-like conjunctive queries), the problems can be solved in polynomial space. The article also uses the counter machine technique to prove that for a restricted subclass of first-order queries with linear constraints over integers and natural numbers, the containment and equivalence problems are undecidable for finite databases but can be solved for a specific type of finite databases.
411939	41193961	Synchronizability of Conversations among Web Services	The authors present a framework for analyzing interactions among Web services that use asynchronous messaging. They model these interactions as conversations and propose a model checking problem to determine if a given composite Web service satisfies a given LTL property. However, they find that this problem becomes undecidable for unbounded message queues due to state space explosion. To address this, they propose a technique called synchronizability analysis, which allows for the use of synchronous communication in place of asynchronous. They also provide conditions for checking synchronizability and demonstrate its usefulness in verifying composite Web services with unbounded message queues. Additionally, they show how synchronizability analysis can be used to check the realizability of conversation specifications and compare it to the Message Sequence Charts. The authors have integrated this analysis into a tool for analyzing composite Web services.
411940	411940149	A workflow net similarity measure based on transition adjacency relations	In business process management, determining the similarity or distance between two processes is essential for activities like process retrieval, process mining, and process integration. While various approaches have been proposed for measuring this similarity, there is no widely accepted definition or method. This paper defines similarity and distance based on firing sequences in workflow nets (WF-nets) and introduces transition adjacency relations (TARs) as a practical way to compare processes. It is shown that this distance measure is a metric and can be efficiently calculated using model reduction techniques. Experiments on artificial and real-life processes confirm the effectiveness of this approach.
411940	41194085	Querying business process models based on semantics	Business process management technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, resulting in a larger number of business process models being created. Managing such a large quantity of models poses a challenge, and the ability to query these models is essential. This allows designers to find related models and make changes, saving time and reducing errors. To facilitate this, a language called BQL has been proposed for expressing requirements based on semantics. An efficient method for computing semantic features and the use of indexes for query processing has also been adopted. Furthermore, the approach takes into account the similarity between labels, making it applicable in various scenarios. The proposed approach has been implemented in the system BeehiveZ and has been proven effective through analysis and experiments.
411940	41194047	A label-free similarity measure between workflow nets	Business process management involves various activities such as process search, process clustering, and process mining, which require determining the similarity between two process models. However, existing approaches for measuring behavioral similarity between business processes rely on proper task labeling. This means that the similarity between two processes can differ greatly depending on the labeling scheme used. To address this issue, a new approach is proposed in this paper, which focuses on the control flow structures of processes and disregards task labels. This label-free similarity measure is based on transition adjacent relations (TARs) and uses workflow nets (WF-nets). An efficient algorithm for this measure is also presented, and experimental results on artificial and real-life processes are discussed.
411941	41194151	Monitoring Influenza Trends through Mining Social Media	This paper analyzes the correlation between Google search queries for influenza-like-illness (ILI) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seasonal ILI reporting data. It also evaluates trends in blog posts discussing influenza and identifies influential bloggers and communities that could play a role in disseminating information during a potential outbreak or epidemic. The study suggests that using web and social media (WSM) can aid in detecting increases in ILI and proposes a response strategy that utilizes WSM to reduce the impact of an infectious disease outbreak. The paper concludes with recommendations for expanding ILI-trend identification and creating an integrated Public Health and WSM community intervention campaign. 
411941	41194141	Activity Recognition Using Graphical Features from Smart Phone Sensor.	The authors have developed a graphical feature-based framework that combines data from various sensor networks and represents it as a graph. They then extract graphical features from the graph and combine them with non-graphical features specific to the application. This approach is applied to predict activities of smart phone users using GPS sensor data. The location categories are represented as nodes in the graph and user movement between locations is represented as edges. The addition of these graphical features to the basic sensor data features results in a 7.27% improvement in activity recognition accuracy. The best performing feature set includes the existence of nodes.
411941	4119414	Learning from Examples in a Single Graph	Graphs are a powerful way to represent data, but most learning systems cannot accept them as input. This limits their ability to convey relationships between data to both machines and humans. Even among systems that can handle graph-based data, most require examples for each class to be in separate graphs. However, a new learner has been developed that can use a single, connected graph with all training examples embedded within it. This eliminates the need for disjoint graphs and reduces the need for preprocessing. A new metric has also been proposed to determine the value of a classification. An experiment was conducted on sea surface temperature data to test the effectiveness of this learner. The resulting program only requires minimal preprocessing and can produce substructures that can be used to classify novel graphs. This eliminates the need for excising potentially vital information and improves performance.
411942	41194225	Two-way coupling of rigid and deformable bodies	The proposed framework allows for the full two-way coupling of both rigid and deformable bodies through a unified time integration scheme and individual two-way coupled algorithms. This eliminates the need for ad hoc methods to address stability issues and allows for the treatment of key aspects of both types of bodies, such as contact, collision, stacking, and friction for rigid bodies, and arbitrary constitutive models, thin shells, and self-collisions for deformable bodies. Additionally, the framework supports advanced features such as proportional derivative controlled articulation between rigid bodies, which can lead to the simulation of new phenomena and the design of deformable creatures that interact realistically with their environment.
411942	41194252	Interpenetration free simulation of thin shell rigid bodies.	The proposed algorithm ensures that objects in a rigid body simulation do not overlap or intersect, improving accuracy and robustness while eliminating the need for additional methods to separate objects. Collision and contact resolution are handled separately, with the first step guaranteeing non-interfering geometry through an approximation of continuous collision detection. This allows for handling of thin and flat objects moving at high speeds. A fail-safe method is also introduced for efficient interpenetration resolution. In the second step, a contact model is used to handle thin shells in close proximity, taking into account their instantaneous positions at the end of the time step.
411942	41194221	Nonconvex rigid bodies with stacking	This article discusses the simulation of nonconvex rigid bodies and their interactions, such as collision, contact, and friction. The authors suggest using a dual representation of the geometry, with a triangulated surface and a signed distance function on a grid. They also propose a new approach to time integration that incorporates collision and contact processing, eliminating the need for arbitrary threshold velocities. The results of this approach are shown to match the theoretical solution for blocks sliding and stopping on inclined planes with friction. Additionally, the authors introduce a new shock propagation algorithm for more efficient treatment of contact. These techniques are demonstrated on various problems, including a stacking problem with 1000 nonconvex rigid bodies.
411943	41194362	Robust Gaze Estimation Via Normalized Iris Center-Eye Corner Vector	Gaze estimation is important in various practical scenarios, but accurately estimating gaze with just a single web-cam is still difficult. This paper presents a method called the normalized iris center-eye corner (NIC-EC) vector, which uses facial features and pupil centers to improve the accuracy of single web-cam based gaze estimation. An interpolation method is used to map the NIC-EC vector to points of regard. Experimental results showed that this method has significantly improved accuracy compared to previous methods, with an average accuracy of 1.66 degrees even with slight head movements.
411943	41194321	Accurately estimating rigid transformations in registration using a boosting-inspired mechanism.	Feature extraction and matching are important techniques used in various tasks such as object registration, modeling, retrieval, and recognition. However, these methods often introduce false matches due to various factors such as lack of features, noise, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. This can lead to inaccurate estimation of the underlying transformation needed to align overlapping shapes. To address this issue, a novel boosting-inspired method is proposed in this paper. It involves three steps: estimating the transformation using weighted least squares, estimating boosting parameters and regularizing them using Tsallis entropy, and re-estimating weights using Shannon entropy and a maximum fusion rule. This process is iterated and the final optimal transformation is estimated as a weighted average of the transformations from the latest iterations. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing methods and can recover the transformation with an error as small as 5% from point matches.
411943	41194331	Tracking Multiple Video Targets with an Improved GM-PHD Tracker.	The paper proposes an improved Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) tracker with weight penalization to accurately track multiple moving targets from a video. The tracker incorporates an entropy-based birth intensity estimation method to eliminate false positives caused by noisy video data. It also uses a weight-penalized method with multi-feature fusion to accurately track targets in close movement. For targets without occlusion, a weight matrix is constructed and ambiguous weights are penalized according to fused target features. For targets with occlusion, a robust game-theoretical method is used. Experiments on various video scenarios show the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed tracker compared to existing methods.
411944	41194419	An algebraic semantics of event-based architectures	This article proposes a mathematical framework for event-based architectures, with the goal of characterizing the modularization properties and supporting the categorical approach to architectural modeling. The use of this formalization allows for the integration of both synchronous and asynchronous interactions in the same modeling approach. The proposed framework is based on transition systems with events and utilizes a family of logics to support different levels of abstraction. This is seen as a first step towards engineering architectural styles.
411944	41194426	New Insights on Architectural Connectors	This study aims to bridge the gap between two distinct approaches to system modeling, namely the categorical approach and the algebraic approach. By mapping the CommUnity program, which utilizes categorical colimits, to the Tile Model, which uses algebraic operators, the researchers were able to establish a connection between the two methods. The results of this work include a decomposition method for CommUnity programs and a strong link between the colimit computation and the abstract semantics of configurations. This study demonstrates that the encoding of a CommUnity diagram is equivalent to the encoding of its colimit, providing a promising first step towards reconciling these two approaches in system modeling.
411944	41194445	Modelling the GSM Handover Protocol in CommUnity	CommUnity is a software architecture approach that uses category theory to define its precise mathematical semantics. It emphasizes the separation of computation, coordination, and distribution, and offers a state-based language for describing component behavior. The approach also gives special attention to composition and the emergence of system properties from interconnected components. The paper discusses the approach and its tool support, using the GSM handover protocol as an example. The authors also outline a framework for implementing distributed execution of CommUnity specifications using Klava, a Java library for mobile agent systems that uses tuple spaces.
411945	41194512	Tool-supported compression of UML class diagrams	Tool-supported compression techniques have been developed for UML class diagrams. These techniques involve hiding less important parts of the diagram, which can be revealed again at selected points. This allows users to gradually refine the diagram from an abstract view to more detailed ones, making it easier to manage large diagrams and understand the overall architecture of an object-oriented legacy system. The compressed form of the diagram can be created automatically or with human control. A management algorithm and prototype implementation are also presented.
411945	41194561	Active text for structuring and understanding source code	This paper discusses the use of non-linear active text as a medium for structuring and browsing source code. While traditional program editors are character-based, the authors argue that incorporating non-textual elements such as pictures, links, folds, and annotations can improve the readability of programs. They demonstrate this through examples and explain how their approach differs from syntax-oriented editors. The implementation was done in the Oberon system, which allowed for object-oriented extensions. This paper was published in SOFTWARE - Practice and Experience in July 1996.
411945	41194522	Automated Support for Modeling OO Software	Object-oriented development presents a solution to the challenge of creating executable software components from requirements in a systematic way. This approach allows for a smooth transition between phases and the use of various tools. Current CASE tools for object-oriented development support graphical modeling from different perspectives, consistency checking, storage, and code generation. However, automation within the development process is limited. In OOAD, dynamic modeling is used to specify the behavior of objects, particularly those responsible for controlling other objects. This can be achieved through finite-state machines, which consist of states associated with actions and transitions associated with events. The actions of a state are executed when it becomes the current state of the object. 
411946	41194665	Maximizing Barrier Coverage Lifetime with Mobile Sensors	Sensor networks play a crucial role in detection and tracking tasks, and one of their main purposes is to provide coverage. The goal of this study is to maximize the coverage lifetime of a barrier using mobile sensors with limited battery power. Coverage lifetime is measured as the time until a sensor dies, leading to a breakdown in coverage. Energy is consumed both for mobility and coverage, with the latter being dependent on the radius of the sensor. The study focuses on two variants: fixed radii and variable radii, and proposes parametric search algorithms for both cases. The study also discusses the challenges and limitations of the variable radii problem, showing its complexity and providing approximation results for the fixed radii problem in certain scenarios.
411946	41194673	Application of halftoning algorithms to location dependent sensor placement	In this study, we examine the placement of sensors in a network with varying sensing ranges based on terrain features. This is done in order to maximize coverage. By using digital halftoning algorithms commonly used in image processing, we can effectively solve this sensor placement problem. The problem is reduced to an image halftoning problem and two known algorithms, dither mask halftoning and direct binary search, are applied. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, which can also be applied to the problem of preferential coverage.
411946	411946104	“Green” Barrier Coverage with Mobile Sensors	Mobile sensors are placed on a line segment and have a single energy source for both movement and sensing. The amount of energy used for movement is proportional to the distance traveled, while the energy used for sensing is proportional to the radius raised to a constant exponent. The problem is to efficiently cover the barrier with these sensors, given their initial locations and a coverage time requirement. The solution involves assigning destinations and coverage radii to each sensor. There are two variations of the problem based on whether the radii are fixed or variable. The objective is to minimize the total energy used by all sensors or the maximum energy used by any sensor. An efficient solution is presented for the variable radii case, while the fixed radii case is shown to be NP-hard. Additional results are given for special cases such as stationary sensors or uniform fixed radii.
411947	41194745	Mobile multi-layered IPsec	To improve the efficiency of wireless networks, smart forwarding and processing of packets in access routers is crucial. However, when end-to-end encryption is used, access routers cannot provide these services as the necessary information is encrypted. The Multi-layered IPsec (ML-IPsec) protocol was developed to expose certain portions of the packet to intermediate network elements, allowing them to enhance performance. In this paper, ML-IPsec is extended to support mobility in wireless networks. A key distribution protocol and two mobility protocols compatible with Mobile IP are defined and implemented. Measurements show that integrated Mobile IP/ML-IPsec handoffs result in a pause of 53-100 milliseconds, with only 28-75 milliseconds due to ML-IPsec. The implementation of ML-IPsec, when combined with SNOOP, significantly increases throughput compared to standard TCP over IPsec. A dynamic version of ML-IPsec is also proposed, allowing for a balance between performance and security. 
411947	41194735	A Flexible Privacy-Enhanced Location-Based Services System Framework and Practice	The paper discusses the increasing importance of location based services (LBS) in next generation wireless systems. However, there is a conflict between the need for user privacy and the use of location information. To address this, the paper proposes a framework for privacy enhanced LBS. It classifies the services and suggests a hierarchical key distribution method, where location information is encrypted under different keys and only distributed to group members with permission. Four methods for delivering hierarchical location information without compromising privacy are proposed, along with a key tree rebalancing algorithm for efficient group key management. The paper also presents a practical LBS system implementation that offers flexible location information access and good efficiency and scalability.
411947	41194741	Relay-Based Multi-Hop Access To Wireless Mesh Networks	Wireless mesh networks are becoming popular for providing widespread network access through different radio technologies. This paper presents a group of distributed algorithms for establishing a multi-hop relay network to connect to the backbone in wireless mesh networks. These algorithms involve finding paths, allocating frequencies, selecting paths, and fine-tuning the resulting relay network. The study demonstrates that the performance of the relay network formed by these algorithms is almost as good as the network's optimal performance.
411948	41194858	Exploring the structure of rule based systems	The article discusses the importance of understanding the internal structure of rule-based expert systems in order to effectively measure and assess their performance. While previous attempts have been made to formalize this structure through the concept of a rule base execution path, these definitions have been found to be inadequate. The paper presents a new formal definition for rule base execution paths, which has been integrated into a tool called Path Hunter. This tool was used to analyze a rule base of 442 CLIPS rules, and successfully controlled the issue of combinatorial explosion that can occur during path enumeration. The analysis revealed important considerations for the development of rule-based systems.
411948	41194868	Verifying ontological commitment in knowledge-based systems	An ontology is a set of concepts and their relationships within a specific field of knowledge. For knowledge-based systems to work together, they must agree on a common ontology. This article explains how existing verification techniques can be used to ensure that a knowledge-based system is committed to a given ontology. The method takes into account that different representation languages may be used for the ontology and knowledge base, and includes translation in the verification process. While the specific languages used may vary, the method can be applied to a wide range of projects. 
411948	41194861	Evaluation of verification tools for knowledge-based systems	Validation of knowledge-based systems (KBS) has become a major challenge in their development. Verification of correctness and completeness, considered to be the most difficult aspects of validation, has led to the development of various software tools. However, these tools have not been widely adopted due to a lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating their effectiveness. This paper presents an experimental study of three KBS verification tools - a consistency checker, a completeness checker, and a testing tool for correctness. The tools are evaluated based on their ability to identify faults in a complex KBS application and their cost. The study shows that each tool is effective at detecting certain types of faults and their capabilities are complementary, which was not previously known.
411949	41194928	On Clock-Based Fault Analysis Attack For An Aes Hardware Using Rsl	Random Switching Logic (RSL) is a technique proposed in 2004 as a countermeasure against Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. It was applied to an AES hardware prototype and tested with a 0.13-mu m standard CMOS library. However, despite its purpose to resist DPA attacks, Clock-based Fault Analysis (CFA) was able to reveal secret information from the prototype chip. This paper explains the mechanism of the CFA attack and discusses its success against the RSL-AES implementation. It also proposes an ideal RSL-AES implementation that can resist CFA attacks.
411949	41194921	An Efficient Countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis Using Configurable Delay Blocks	This paper introduces a new countermeasure against Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA), a type of fault attack that exploits the relationship between fault sensitivity and secret information. Previous studies have shown that FSA can break conventional countermeasures against Differential Fault Analysis (DFA). The proposed countermeasure uses configurable delay blocks (CDBs) to detect both DFA and FSA attacks based on setup time violation faults. By post-manufacture configuring the delay blocks, the overhead in operating frequency can be minimized. The paper presents an implementation of the countermeasure for an AES module, describes its configuration method, and evaluates its hardware overhead through experiments on both an ASIC and a prototype FPGA implementation. 
411949	41194954	Fault Sensitivity Analysis	The paper introduces a new type of fault-based attack called the Fault Sensitivity Analysis (FSA) attack, which is different from existing methods such as Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) in that it does not rely on faulty ciphertext values. Instead, FSA uses the concept of fault sensitivity, which is the point at which a faulted output begins to exhibit detectable characteristics. This fault sensitivity is influenced by sensitive data and can be used to retrieve secret keys. The paper presents two practical FSA attacks on two AES hardware implementations and shows that one of them, WDDL-AES, is not completely secure against setup-time violation attacks. The paper also discusses a potential countermeasure using masking techniques.
411950	41195085	Practical Password Recovery Attacks On Md4 Based Prefix And Hybrid Authentication Protocols	This paper discusses practical password recovery attacks on two challenge and response authentication protocols that use MD4. The number of queries required for these attacks is a crucial factor, as the opportunity for an attacker to ask queries is limited in real protocols. Previous methods required 2(37) queries, which is almost impossible in real protocols. However, the proposed attack only needs 17 queries and 2(34) MD4 computations to recover up to 8-octet passwords, and 2(10) queries and 2(41) MD4 computations for 12-octet passwords. When using the hybrid approach, previous methods required 2(63) queries, while the proposed attack only needs 28 queries and 2(39) MD4 computations to recover up to 8-octet passwords. This is achieved by guessing part of the password and simulating intermediate chaining variables from observed hash values.
411950	41195075	Improved collision attack on MD4 with probability almost 1	At the EUROCRYPT2005 conference, a team proposed a collision attack on the MD4 hash function. They claimed a success probability of 2−6 to 2−2 and a complexity of less than 28 MD4 operations. However, their paper contained typos and oversights. This paper reevaluates the success probability and points out the errors in the original paper. It also proposes a new method for modifying messages in the third round of MD4. The reevaluation shows a success probability of 2−5.61, and the improved method can find collisions with almost 100% probability and a complexity of only 3 MD4 operations. This is 85 times faster than the original method. 
411950	41195052	Improved Collision Attack on MD4	In this paper, a new attack method for finding collisions in the MD4 hash function is proposed. This improved method has a higher success rate with a probability of almost 1 and a lower average complexity of three times the MD4 hash operations. This is a significant improvement compared to the previous attack method (1), which had a probability range of 2¡6 to 2¡2 and an average complexity of 28 MD4 hash operations. The paper also highlights the shortcomings of the original attack method and its modifications in (1), pointing out the lack of sufficient conditions and imprecise modifications.
411951	41195148	All-pairs bottleneck paths for general graphs in truly sub-cubic time	The all-pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem involves finding the maximum capacity path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph with non-negative edge capacities. This problem was first studied in operations research and is now being addressed with a new sub-cubic algorithm for general dense graphs. The algorithm uses a procedure for computing the (max, min)-product of two matrices in O(n2+Ω/3) time, where n is the number of vertices and Ω is the exponent for matrix multiplication. This allows for the extraction of an explicit maximum bottleneck path in linear time.
411951	41195119	Finding heaviest H-subgraphs in real weighted graphs, with applications	The MAX H-SUBGRAPH problem involves finding a subgraph with the maximum total weight in a graph G with assigned weights to its vertices and edges. The article presents new strongly polynomial algorithms for this problem, some of which use fast matrix multiplication. A more general problem, the all pairs MAX H-SUBGRAPH problem, is also solved for vertex-weighted graphs with n vertices. The runtime for finding heaviest triangles for all pairs is O(n2+1/(4-ω)), which can be improved using rectangular matrix multiplication. The article also presents improved algorithms for the edge-weighted case, including an O(m2−1/k log n)-time algorithm for finding the heaviest cycle of length 2k or 2k−1 and an O(n3/log n)-time randomized algorithm for finding the heaviest cycle of any fixed length. The methods used in these algorithms can also be applied to other related problems, such as finding chromatic H-subgraphs in edge-colored graphs and computing the most significant bits of the distance product of two real matrices in subcubic time.
411951	41195136	Improved Distance Sensitivity Oracles via Fast Single-Source Replacement Paths	A distance sensitivity oracle is a data structure in a directed graph that returns the shortest path between two nodes, excluding a specified edge. This is useful for recovering quickly from edge failures. This paper introduces a new oracle for graphs with integer weights in the range [-M, M], with a preprocessing time of Õ(Mnω+1/2 +Mnω+α(4-ω)) and query time of Õ(n1-α). The previous best oracle had a slower preprocessing time and query time. The paper also presents an algorithm for computing all replacement paths from a given source, with a runtime of Õ(APSP(n, M))) time for positive weights, and Õ(Mnω) for all weights. This matches the best known runtime for a similar problem.
411952	41195252	Bounding Performance Loss in Approximate MDP Homomorphisms	The article discusses a metric for measuring behavior similarity between states in a Markov decision process (MDP) that takes action similarity into account. This metric corresponds to the classes of states defined by MDP homomorphisms and can be used to upper-bound the difference in optimal value function between different states. It is shown to be tighter than previous bounds provided by bisimulation metrics. The metric is applicable for both discrete and continuous actions and an algorithm is provided for constructing approximate homomorphisms using this metric. Previous research on this topic has primarily relied on heuristics. 
411952	41195244	On-the-Fly Algorithms for Bisimulation Metrics	This article discusses the problem of finding approximate equivalences in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with rewards, using bisimulation metrics. It builds upon previous work by Ferns et al. (2004) and introduces an extension that uses the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure the similarity between states. The authors address two limitations of the previous framework by incorporating "on-the-fly" methods that prioritize certain state comparisons and by using heuristics to obtain approximate state comparisons. They prove that this approach converges to the correct value of the bisimulation metric. Additionally, they demonstrate how this method can be applied to generate new algorithmic strategies for prediction and control in MDPs. 
411952	41195264	A Canonical Form for Weighted Automata and Applications to Approximate Minimization.	The problem of creating approximations for weighted finite automata (WFA) is studied, as these automata are closely connected to rational series. A rational series is a function that can be computed by a finite WFA. This relationship is similar to that of regular languages and ordinary automata. Hankel matrices, infinite matrices associated with rational series, are important in the theory of minimal WFA. This study presents (1) a method to compute the singular value decomposition of Hankel matrices using finite WFA, (2) a new canonical form for finite WFA based on this decomposition, and (3) an algorithm to create approximate minimizations of a given WFA. The algorithm produces a smaller WFA that closely mimics the behavior of the original one, with the desired size as input. 
411953	41195337	The TELAR mobile mashup platform for Nokia internet tablets	The rise of Web 2.0 has led to an increase in online data and information services such as websites, Wikis, and web services. This has also given rise to the development of Mashups, which are web applications that combine data from multiple sources into one service. This is made possible by the use of script languages and web development platforms. Additionally, mobile devices are becoming more powerful and have ubiquitous access to the web, allowing for integration of local sensors such as GPS. This enables mobile applications to adapt to the user's current situation, particularly their location. The Telar Mashup platform is a client-server solution that facilitates the creation of adaptive Mashups for mobile devices, using wrappers to integrate data from web-based services and the DCCI specification to incorporate context information from local sensors. The platform is demonstrated on the Nokia N810 Internet Tablet. 
411953	41195346	Federated Spatial Cursors	The increasing use of small mobile devices for data-heavy tasks requires consideration of their limitations in system design, such as memory and communication bandwidth. To address this, the application should have more control over the data delivery process, taking into account device status, communication costs, and user needs. This paper proposes a flexible and scalable approach through spatially federated cursor functionality, utilizing loosely coupled data sources with simple object retrieval interfaces. This allows for better adaptation of data delivery and retrieval based on the device and user's needs.
411953	41195336	Exploiting Type and Space in a Main Memory Query Engine	The increasing availability of spatial data through web portals and wireless service providers has made data selection based on object type and real-world position crucial. To address integration and performance challenges, a main memory query engine is proposed for ad hoc queries. This engine can easily be deployed in large-scale data integration systems and is optimized for spatial and type dimensions through a multi-dimensional index structure. This approach has been shown to significantly improve performance compared to using separate indexes. The mapping of type IDs to values in the type dimension is also discussed in detail, allowing for interactive use of large data sets.
411954	41195437	Customization and provisioning of complex event processing using TOSCA.	In the world of Internet of Things, a large amount of sensor data is constantly being produced and shared among devices in smart environments. This poses a challenge as the data needs to be processed quickly and efficiently to conserve network resources. Complex event processing (CEP) is a commonly used method to handle this data. However, automatically provisioning CEP systems can be difficult as they require customization to be used in IoT scenarios. This can be a tedious task if done manually. To address this issue, a new approach based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications standard has been developed, allowing for the customization and provisioning of CEP systems with all necessary data sources, sinks, and queries.
411954	41195474	Building the data warehouse of frequent itemsets in the DWFIST approach	Data mining tasks can generate large amounts of data, leading to a new knowledge management problem. Frequent itemset mining is one such task, and various approaches have been proposed to address this issue. However, these approaches have limitations, especially when dealing with data streams. The DWFIST approach aims to overcome these limitations by providing a Data Warehouse of Frequent ItemSets. This allows for efficient and flexible access to frequent itemsets and related patterns, without needing the original data during the analysis phase. This paper outlines the construction of such a data warehouse, which provides a standardized view for developing analytical tools.
411954	41195488	Context-Aware Decision Information Packages: An Approach to Human-Centric Smart Factories.	Industry 4.0 is a concept that involves incorporating new trends like data-intensive cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, and mobile applications into production environments. Even though it focuses on highly automated engineering and manufacturing processes, human decision making is still crucial in the product lifecycle. To support effective decision making, humans need to have access to relevant data based on the current context. This data is retrieved from various sources such as bill of material systems, product data management, and manufacturing execution systems. To address this issue, the concept of decision information packages is introduced, which allows for the composition of context-specific engineering data from different sources. This is achieved through a context-aware engineering data model and corresponding operators. The paper proposes an architecture and prototype implementation based on a real case scenario. 
411955	4119554	New algorithms for finding approximate frequent item sets	Standard frequent item set mining requires all items in a set to be present in a transaction, which can make it difficult to find relevant groups of items. By relaxing the support definition, allowing for some missing items, approximate, fault-tolerant, or fuzzy item sets can be found. This paper presents two new algorithms for finding such item sets: one based on cover similarities and subset size occurrence distribution, and the other using a clustering approach with item cover distances and a one-dimensional Sammon projection. These algorithms are demonstrated to be effective in a concept detection task and neuron ensemble detection in simulated parallel spike trains.
411955	41195540	Fixed Parameter Algorithms For The Minimum Weight Triangulation Problem	This article discusses four fixed parameter algorithms for finding the minimum weight triangulation of a simple polygon with n-k vertices on the perimeter and k vertices in the interior. The algorithms use a divide-and-conquer approach and a variant of dynamic programming. They are based on two observations about triangulations: triangle splits and path splits. The first two algorithms use only one split type, while the last two combine them for improved time complexity. The goal is to simplify and better understand these approaches. The algorithms were implemented in Java and experiments were conducted to evaluate their performance.
411955	41195519	Finding neural assemblies with frequent item set mining.	Cell assemblies are groups of neurons that work together to process information in the brain. Recent advances in technology have allowed for the recording of hundreds of neurons at the same time, but most studies still focus on pairwise interactions between neurons. To fully understand the relationships between neurons, higher-order correlations must be identified. The Accretion method, proposed in 1978, inspired a new method for detecting cell assemblies using frequent item set mining. This method effectively searches for individual spike patterns that occur frequently in the recorded data. The main challenge in detecting cell assemblies is the problem of multiple testing, which leads to a high number of false discoveries. To address this, the new method shifts the focus from specific assemblies to spike patterns of a certain size. This reduces the number of necessary tests and allows for more reliable detection of synchronous activity. Additionally, the new method is computationally efficient.
411956	411956175	Playing Fast and Loose with Music Recognition.	In this study, the authors discuss their experience developing a music recognition system that allows musicians to incorporate digital interactions into their performances. They worked with 23 musicians of varying skill levels and instruments, and the system evolved quickly to meet their needs. The system allows musicians to compose music fragments that can trigger digital interactions with varying levels of embellishment, disguise, and looseness. The authors highlight the challenges of control, feedback, and attunement in incorporating technology into performance practice and suggest the use of written notations in other recognition-based systems. Overall, the study supports the idea of intentionally introducing looseness into interactive systems to enhance musical expression.
411956	41195633	Extending authoring tools for location-aware applications with an infrastructure visualization layer	Current authoring tools for location-aware applications typically involve placing trigger zones on a map and linking them to events and media assets. However, studies have shown that the limitations of the underlying ubiquitous computing infrastructure can greatly impact the user experience. To address this, we propose a new approach where designers work with three layers of information: physical world, digital media, and visualizations of the infrastructure. We have developed a prototype authoring tool that implements this approach and used it to create a location-based game called Tycoon. However, there are challenges in generalizing this approach to more advanced authoring tools, such as obtaining and visualizing infrastructure and map data, and specifying the relationship between digital content and these layers. 
411956	411956201	Enabling Hand-Crafted Visual Markers at Scale.	The increasing use of locative media and augmented reality in everyday life has led to the need for large-scale, aesthetically pleasing visual markers. In response, a designer-centric approach has been developed where skilled designers create seed designs that are automatically combined to produce subtle variations of a common theme. This is achieved through the use of two new techniques: area order codes and visual checksums, which build upon the existing d-touch topological approach. These markers can then be recombined to generate numerous variations, as demonstrated through the creation of personalized and interactive wallpaper. However, it is important for technology to support designers in balancing scalability, aesthetics, and reliability in order to create visually appealing interactive designs.
411957	4119574	Simple Plans Or Sophisticated Habits? State, Transition And Learning Interactions In The Two-Step Task	The 'two-step' behavioural task has become popular for differentiating between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning and producing neurophysiologically-friendly decision data. However, the task's structure can affect the strategies used and the accuracy of conclusions drawn from behavioural performance. A balance must be struck between the need for stochasticity to distinguish strategies and the need for determinism to incentivize subjects to optimize their choices. Changes to the task structure can create correlations that make model-free strategies appear as model-based. A suggested correction to analysis can mitigate this issue, but understanding these complexities is crucial for fully utilizing the two-step task in behavioural neuroscience.
411957	41195762	Dopamine: generalization and bonuses.	The temporal difference model explains the activity of primate dopamine neurons as reporting a prediction error for future reward. This is supported by experimental evidence, but there are instances where the activity seems abnormal under the model. This paper discusses two types of anomalies - generalization and novelty responses - and proposes that dopamine cells also play a role in guiding exploration and responding to different types of reward bonuses. This additional function of dopamine is linked to its attentional and psychomotor effects, providing a computational role in guiding exploration.
411957	41195731	Differential priors for elastic nets	The elastic net and related algorithms, such as generative topographic mapping, are important techniques for dimension-reduction problems. These methods are based on priors that determine the expected topological and geometric properties of the maps. However, only a limited range of priors have been explored so far. This study introduces a more general family of priors based on discrete, high-order derivative operators. The type of discrete approximation used has a significant impact on the resulting map, as shown through theoretical analysis and empirical results using a new and improved iterative elastic net algorithm. The effects of different priors on simulated ocular dominance columns are also demonstrated. 
411958	41195856	Honey Encryption Beyond Message Recovery Security.	Juels and Ristenpart developed honey encryption (HE), which ensures message recovery security despite attacks that try all possible keys. This is particularly useful for password-based encryption, where keys are low entropy. Other HE schemes based on the Juels-Ristenpart construction were later proposed for password management and long-term protection of genetic data. However, in this setting, message recovery security is a weak property and does not prevent an attacker from obtaining partial information about plaintexts or altering ciphertexts. To address this, the authors introduce target-distribution semantic-security and target-distribution non-malleability notions and prove that a variation of the JR HE construction can meet them. Their analysis is different from previous work and they also provide a formal proof that an unbounded attacker can always succeed in message recovery with a limited number of encryptions of known plaintexts.
411958	4119585	Honey Encryption: Encryption beyond the Brute-Force Barrier	Honey encryption (HE) is a method of encrypting messages using keys that are vulnerable to guessing attacks. It creates a ciphertext that appears valid but contains a fake message when decrypted with an incorrect key. This makes it difficult for attackers to determine if decryption was successful. HE allows weak passwords to be used for encryption, making it nearly impossible for even a strong attacker to decrypt the message. It can be used for encrypting passwords in a password manager or credentials used in SSH. HE combines the use of honey objects and decoys with cryptography principles to enhance system security.
411958	41195838	Key Rotation for Authenticated Encryption.	The paper discusses the need for periodically rotating encryption keys used to protect stored data. It compares the hybrid encryption technique used by Amazon and Google, which has potential security risks, to the symmetric updatable encryption scheme introduced by Boneh et al. in CRYPTO 2013. This scheme allows for full key rotation without decryption, using re-encryption tokens to maintain security. The paper presents a systematic study of updatable Authenticated Encryption (AE) and introduces new security notions to strengthen the confidentiality and integrity goals. It also proposes a modified hybrid approach that meets these goals efficiently. The paper then discusses the implementation of this scheme using common cryptographic components and reports on its performance.
411959	41195924	Delay-Insensitive On-Chip Communication Link using Low-Swing Simultaneous Bidirectional Signaling	This paper introduces a new asynchronous delay-insensitive on-chip link structure that allows for simultaneous data exchange between two modules. Unlike traditional dual-rail links, this design only requires N+1 interconnects instead of 2N+1, making it more cost-effective for future systems. The transceiver circuits are designed using multiplevalued current-mode logic and have a low power consumption of 8.32mW with a 689ps propagation delay and 5mm interconnect length. Potential applications for this link include use in GALS systems, NoC routers, and adaptive systems. The circuit was simulated using Cadence Analog Spectre with 0.13um CMOS technology.
411959	411959115	Full-Duplex Link Implementation Using Dual-Rail Encoding And Multiple-Valued Current-Mode Logic	This paper introduces a new asynchronous on-chip link structure that allows for simultaneous data exchange between two modules. The link uses a 2-color 1-phase communication protocol, which only requires one communication action per transfer, making it potentially faster than traditional handshake-based protocols. The transceiver circuits are designed using multiple-valued current-mode logic, and the linear summation is done through wiring without active devices, simplifying the circuitry. The link consumes 16mW of power with a 90mV voltage swing and has a propagation delay of 178ps for a 2mm interconnect length. The circuit was designed and simulated using Cadence Analog Spectre and a 0.13um CMOS technology.
411959	41195959	High-Performance Long Noc Link Using Delay-Insensitive Current-Mode Signaling	The article discusses the implementation of a high-performance long-range NoC (network-on-chip) link that can efficiently support topologies such as torus and fat-tree structures, which require long-distance point-to-point communication. The proposed link uses multilevel current-mode signaling and a delay-insensitive two-phase 1-of-4 encoding, which reduces communication latency and allows for high throughput without the need for pipelining or repeaters. The performance of this link is compared to two reference voltage-mode interconnects, one with pipelining and the other with optimal repeater insertion. The current-mode link achieves higher throughput and lower power consumption, even with crosstalk considered. This technology has the potential to greatly improve the performance and efficiency of network-on-chip designs.
411960	41196024	Task oriented weighting in multi-criteria analysis	This paper introduces a new method for determining criteria weights in decision making processes involving multiple conflicting factors. A fuzzy knowledge base is used to address imprecise decision making and criteria weights are determined by specifying the state of each task requirement. This approach is incorporated into a fuzzy multi-criteria analysis model and tested on a dredger dispatching problem in China. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its potential for general application in decision making. This task oriented weighting procedure and algorithm have the potential to improve the consistency and accuracy of decision making in various situations.
411960	41196047	Customer Order-Driven BOCR-Based Supplier Selection	This paper presents a new method for choosing the best supplier to fulfill a specific customer order based on considerations of benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR). The impact of customer order attributes on these dimensions is analyzed and a customer order-driven weighting method is created to determine their relative importance. A multicriteria decision making (MCDM) model is then developed to select the supplier that best meets the BOCR requirements of the customer order. An empirical study is conducted using data from an auto parts company to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
411960	41196051	Modeling subjective evaluation for fuzzy group multicriteria decision making	The paper proposes a new fuzzy multicriteria decision making (MCDM) approach for evaluating decision alternatives involving subjective judgements by a group of decision makers. The approach includes a pairwise comparison process for comparative judgements, a linguistic rating method for absolute judgements, and a hierarchical weighting method for assessing criteria weights. To account for the imprecision of subjective judgements, a group assessment is made using triangular fuzzy numbers. The paper also introduces a new fuzzy MCDM algorithm that incorporates criteria weights in the distance measurement to obtain a preference value for each decision alternative. An empirical study on aircraft selection is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
411961	41196116	Resolution Limits of Sparse Coding in High Dimensions	 Grants DMS-1007062 and DMS- 1209017, and a grant from the Simons FoundationThis paper discusses the issue of detecting sparsity patterns in unknown k-sparse n-dimensional signals observed through m noisy, random linear measurements. This problem arises in various situations, such as statistical model selection, pattern detection, and image acquisition. The main focus of this paper is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving reliable sparsity pattern recovery, taking into account the dimensions m, n, and k, as well as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the minimum-to-average ratio (MAR) of the nonzero entries of the signal. The paper presents a necessary condition of m > 2klog(n − k)/(SNRMAR) for any algorithm to succeed, and a sufficient condition for a computationally-trivial thresholding algorithm. This analysis can provide insight into the limitations of convex programming-based algorithms and can be applied in the context of visual cortex modeling to understand the resolvability of visual features from visual data. The abstract estimation problem considered in this paper involves an unknown sparse signal x, modeled as an n-dimensional real vector with k nonzero components, and the problem of detecting the sparsity pattern of x from an m-dimensional measurement vector y = Ax + d, where A is a known measurement matrix and d is an additive noise vector with a known distribution. 
411961	41196113	Message-Passing De-Quantization With Applications to Compressed Sensing	This paper introduces a new method, called message-passing de-quantization (MPDQ), for estimating a random vector from quantized linear measurements. It is based on a technique called generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) and allows for overcomplete or undercomplete linear expansions and regular or non-regular scalar quantization. MPDQ is computationally simple and can incorporate various priors on the input vector, such as sparsity-inducing priors used in compressed sensing. Under certain assumptions, the error performance of MPDQ can be accurately predicted using a set of scalar state evolution equations. The paper also presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of MPDQ, particularly in cases where oversampling or undersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior is involved. 
411961	41196121	Estimation from lossy sensor data: jump linear modeling and Kalman filtering	This paper discusses the challenges of losses in large sensor networks due to cost, power, and communication constraints. It proposes a model that considers sensor output as a linear stochastic system with random losses, and discrete transitions are modeled using a Markov chain. The optimal estimator for this model is a time-varying Kalman filter, and the average asymptotic estimation error variance can be easily computed using a Linear Matrix Inequality. This model allows for various types of underlying losses, including fixed-length burst errors, two-state models, and partial losses. It also considers changes in both the received data and the underlying system, making it a valuable tool for scenarios with challenging and changing network conditions.
411962	41196230	Capacity of Systems with Queue-Length Dependent Service Quality.	This study focuses on the maximum amount of information that can be reliably processed by a server with a varying level of service quality based on queue length. The capacity of the system is measured in terms of bits processed per unit time, and is influenced by arrival and service process distributions. For systems with one arrival per time slot, a memoryless distribution is optimal, while multiple arrivals can negatively impact the system. This research is driven by the need to incorporate reliability into queuing systems, and has practical applications in crowdsourcing, multimedia communication, and stream computing.
411962	41196216	The Non-Regular CEO Problem	This article discusses the CEO problem for non-regular source distributions, where a CEO needs to estimate data based on independently corrupted observations from a group of agents. The agents cannot communicate before transmitting their observations. This problem is motivated by the practical issue of a CEO needing to estimate beliefs about a sequence of events. The observations are jointly distributed with the data through a given probability function. The article examines the minimum achievable mean squared error distortion in the limit of infinite agents and sum rate. It establishes a convergence of distortion and compares it to previous studies on discrete and Gaussian CEO problems. The article proves achievability through a layered architecture using quantization, entropy coding, and estimation, and proves the converse using the Bayesian Chazan-Zakai-Ziv bound.
411962	41196250	Subblock-Constrained Codes for Real-Time Simultaneous Energy and Information Transfer	This paper discusses a type of receiver that can both decode information and harvest energy from received signals. In cases where the receiver has a limited battery, a signal with intermittent energy can cause power outages. To address this issue, the authors introduce subblock energy-constrained codes (SECCs) that ensure sufficient energy is carried in each subblock. They also study constant subblock-composition codes (CSCCs) that maximize information transfer while meeting energy requirements. Compared to constant composition codes (CCCs), CSCCs have a slight rate loss and a related error exponent. The paper also presents conditions for avoiding power outages and a lower bound on energy usage. Numerical examples show the tradeoff between energy delivery and information transfer rates, with real-time energy usage having less of an impact than real-time information usage.
411963	41196329	Generic Incremental Algorithms for Local Search	Introducing a new constraint in local search requires defining measures for penalty and variable conflicts and implementing incremental algorithms to maintain these measures. This can be time-consuming and reduces productivity. A generic scheme is proposed that automatically generates these measures and algorithms for a constraint described in monadic existential second-order logic with counting. The variable-conflict measure is proven to be bounded by the maximum penalty decrease that can be achieved by changing the value of a variable, ensuring good local search performance. This approach is demonstrated by replacing a built-in global constraint with a modelled version, resulting in competitive runtime and robustness.
411963	4119637	Inferring variable conflicts for local search	To improve the efficiency of local search algorithms, we often only consider moves that change variables that impact the overall penalty. These variables are known as conflicting variables. In this study, we propose a new way to measure the conflict of a variable in a model expressed in existential second-order logic with counting. This measure can be automatically and incrementally evaluated and is bounded by an intuitive conflict measure and the model's penalty. We also show that this approach can successfully replace a built-in global constraint with an ∃SOL+ version while still achieving comparable results.
411963	41196350	Design of Financial CDO Squared Transactions Using Constraint Programming	A fast and efficient method for creating a portfolio design (PD) in finance is presented, with applications in the credit derivatives market. The PD is a generalization of a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) and can be challenging to construct. The method involves embedding smaller designs into the larger PD, along with symmetry breaking, admissibility checking, and reuse of previous designs. This approach has been successful in producing (near-)optimal PDs for collateralized debt obligation squared (CDO2) transactions, which are commonly used in the credit derivatives market. The method has shown to be effective in creating PDs with large numbers of symmetries in a matter of minutes, improving upon previous designs and meeting investor and rating-agency constraints. 
411964	41196433	Properties of Almost All Graphs and Generalized Quantifiers	The study examines 0-1 laws for first-order logic expanded with Lindström quantifiers, which express graph properties. The logic FO[Q] has a 0-1 law if certain conditions on the quantifier Q are met. Using these conditions, it is shown that FO[Rig], with the quantifier for rigidity, has a 0-1 law. However, extensions with quantifiers for Hamiltonicity, regularity, and self-complementarity do not have a 0-1 law. The question of whether there exists a logic that can express Hamiltonicity or rigidity and has a 0-1 law is considered. It is concluded that there is no such logic for Hamiltonicity, but there is one for rigidity. Additionally, the study examines sequences of vectorized quantifiers and shows that adding quantifiers closed under substructures results in 0-1 laws for extensions of first-order logic. These results also apply to infinitary logic with finitely many variables.
411964	41196410	A restricted second order logic for finite structures	The article discusses a modified version of second order logic called SO ω, where the second order quantifiers operate over relations that are closed under a specific equivalence relation called ≡ k. This restricted version is considered to be an effective fragment of the infinitary logic L ω ∞ ω, but it differs from other fragments as it is not based on a fixed point logic. The article explores the connections between SO ω and fixed point logics, demonstrating that their inclusion relations are equivalent to problems in complexity theory. The expressibility of NP-complete problems in this logic is also examined. 
411964	41196427	Ordering finite variable types with generalized quantifiers	The content discusses the relationship between generalized quantifiers and first order logic. It explains that for each variable k, there is a linear pre-order that can be defined using PFP(Q) and Lk(Q)-types in any finite structure. This pre-order is also definable in IFP(Q) for some special classes of quantifiers. The Abiteboul-Vianu theorem is used as an application of these results, showing that for modular counting quantifiers, P=PSPACE if and only if IFP(Q)=PFP(Q) over finite structures. However, there are cases where an ordering of Lk(Q)-types is not definable in IFP(Q), as demonstrated by a polynomial time computable quantifier P.
411965	41196511	Fast $q$-gram Mining on SLP Compressed Strings	This article introduces efficient algorithms for calculating the frequency of $q$-grams in compressed strings represented by a straight line program (SLP). The proposed algorithm has a time and space complexity of $O(qn)$, where $n$ is the size of the SLP. Experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs well on real string data and outperforms other algorithms designed for uncompressed text. The article also discusses potential applications in data mining and classification of string data. 
411965	4119654	A Fully Compressed Pattern Matching Algorithm For Simple Collage Systems	The FCPM problem involves finding patterns in a compressed text without decompressing it. This is difficult because the patterns are also in a compressed form. The paper introduces an algorithm for solving this problem specifically for simple collage systems, which are a type of dictionary-based compression. The algorithm, called FCPM, has a time complexity of O(|D|^2 + mn log |S|), where D is the dictionary, S is a sequence of variables, n is the length of the text, and m is the length of the pattern. This is an improvement from the previous best result of O(m^2n^2) time. 
411965	41196535	Fast q-gram mining on SLP compressed strings	The article discusses the development of algorithms for calculating q-gram frequencies on strings that are represented in compressed form, specifically as a straight line program (SLP). The presented algorithms are simple and efficient, with a time and space complexity of O(qn) for an SLP of size n representing a string T. Experiments show that these algorithms are faster than those working on uncompressed text, particularly for small values of q. The article also mentions potential applications in data mining and classification of string data.
411966	4119669	Connected Identifying Codes	The problem of generating a connected identifying code for a graph is discussed. It is shown that this problem is NP-complete and a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, called ${\\tt ConnectID}$, is proposed which produces a connected code of at most twice the size. When the input code is robust to graph distortions, the size of the output code is related to the best error-correcting code of a given minimum distance. The size of the input and output codes converge for increasing robustness, and simulations on various random graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of ${\\tt ConnectID}$. It is found that for Erdős–Rényi random graphs, the connected codes generated are only 25% larger than unconnected codes, and robustness often provides connectivity without increasing the size of the code.
411966	41196632	Joint Monitoring and Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Robust Identifying Codes	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used to monitor the physical world, but their limitations make it difficult to provide fundamental network services like routing. To address this issue, the theory of identifying codes is used as an abstraction for WSNs. This has been helpful in solving important problems such as localization and contamination detection. In this work, the authors propose an algorithm for generating robust identifying codes with a logarithmic performance guarantee, based on a novel reduction to the set k-multicover problem. This is the first such guarantee for the NP-hard problem of robust identifying codes. Additionally, the identifying-code infrastructure can also be used for efficient routing with small routing tables. Experimental results show the superiority of this approach over previous heuristics.
411966	41196612	Efficient clustering algorithms for self-organizing wireless sensor networks	Wireless sensor networks face challenges in self-organization due to limited bandwidth and energy resources. To improve efficiency, this paper proposes a novel approach for message-efficient clustering, where nodes allocate growth budgets to neighbors. Two algorithms are introduced and evaluated through simulations, showing better results than the commonly used Expanding Ring approach. Another contribution is a randomized methodology for designing cluster initiator timers, ensuring minimal interference and logarithmic network decomposition time. A variant with more concurrency among initiators is also presented, although it produces slightly more clusters. Simulations confirm the analytical results and scalability of the proposed methods. Overall, this research aims to enhance the self-organization of wireless sensor networks.
411967	41196723	Efficient re-resolution of SMT specifications for evolving software architectures	This study introduces a method for efficiently handling changes in a component-based software architecture. By using formal descriptions and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) techniques, the method can identify and carry out the necessary steps to ensure compliance with constraints after each change. The approach is demonstrated on a constraint-satisfaction problem related to cloud-based software services, and is proven to be significantly faster than standard SMT resolution methods. The method streamlines the process of re-resolving system constraints, making it a valuable tool for managing changes in software architectures.
411967	41196733	Establishing a Framework for Dynamic Risk Management in `Intelligent' Aero-Engine Control	Safety critical software systems must have control functions that prevent known hazards from occurring. These bounds are determined through safety analyses and implemented through design features. However, unexpected real-world problems can lead to changes in the operating context, making these bounds invalid. This paper discusses the challenges of dealing with these complex and dynamic problems and proposes a self-management framework for on-line risk management. The framework is demonstrated in the context of using intelligent adaptive controllers for Gas-Turbine Aero Engine control. The framework also enables safety assurance arguments necessary for certification. In highly complex problems, it may not be possible to determine precise behavioural bounds prior to deployment, making on-line risk management essential. 
411967	41196747	Architecting Trustworthy Self-Adaptive Systems (Tutorial)	Architecting self-adaptive software systems is a difficult task, especially when they are used in safety-critical and business-critical applications. These systems need to not only achieve their goals in their initial environment, but also adapt to changes over time while still ensuring correct operation. Traditional software systems use assurance cases to provide guarantees of trustworthiness, but the ENTRUST methodology offers a new approach for self-adaptive systems. This tutorial introduces attendees to self-adaptive systems, assurance cases, and the ENTRUST methodology, and provides practical demonstrations of its use in engineering systems like an unmanned underwater vehicle and a service-based system. This tutorial is beneficial for researchers and software architects interested in self-adaptive and autonomous systems, as well as those interested in rigorous modelling, analysis, and verification of their control software.
411968	41196818	A description of the diamond grid for topological and combinatorial analysis.	A new coordinate system has been developed for all cells in the diamond grid, allowing for easy retrieval of topological relations between cells. This system can be used in various applications, including image processing and shape analysis, as it simplifies operations such as boundary tracking and computation of the Euler characteristic. The system is based on simple integer operations, making it efficient and suitable for implementation in different contexts.
411968	41196810	A Combinatorial 4-Coordinate System for the Diamond Grid	The article introduces a novel coordinate system for cells in the diamond grid, using four dependent coordinates to address voxels, faces, edges, and corners. These coordinates effectively capture the incidence and adjacency relations of the cells, making them useful for morphological and topological operations. The system allows for a more comprehensive understanding of cell structure and can aid in various analytical and practical applications.
411968	41196863	A combinatorial coordinate system for the body-centered cubic grid.	The article introduces a new coordinate system that can be used to represent both the voxels and lower-dimensional cells of a body-centered cubic grid. This system allows for easy capturing of incidence and adjacency relationships between cells using integer triple values. It is suitable for various applications such as topological shape analysis, image processing, and computer graphics due to its effectiveness and efficiency. Overall, the new coordinate system provides a more comprehensive and versatile approach for working with complex grids.
411969	41196952	Transactional Tasks: Parallelism in Software Transactions.	Many programming languages, including Clojure, Scala, and Haskell, offer different models for handling concurrency. However, when these models are combined, their semantics are not always clearly defined. In this paper, the authors explore the combination of futures and Software Transactional Memory (STM). Currently, when futures are created within a transaction, they cannot safely access the transactional state, which can lead to unexpected behavior and violate the serializability of transactions. To address this issue, the authors propose a new construct called transactional tasks, which allow futures to be created within transactions while still providing safe access to the state. Transactional tasks offer several advantages, such as coordination, maintaining serializability, and eliminating non-determinism. Overall, this approach allows for the full utilization of parallelism in a program while preserving the desirable properties of both futures and STM. 
411969	41196972	Enriching the Internet By Acting and Reacting	The rise of rich internet applications (RIAs) has led to a shift towards moving application logic to the client side. This can improve performance and responsiveness, but also presents challenges in terms of concurrency and integrating multiple services. To address these issues, a new programming model based on actors and reactors is proposed. These modular components can be easily coordinated through a unified communication mechanism, reducing the need for complex event-driven code. A collaborative code editor is used as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. 
411969	41196977	Linguistic symbiosis between event loop actors and threads	Concurrency control in modern programming languages can be traced back to two schools: actor-based message passing and thread-based shared-state. This paper discusses a new symbiosis between these two models, specifically between actors represented as event loops and threads. This symbiosis ensures that the actor-based model's invariants are not violated when combined with multithreaded programs. The proposed mapping is demonstrated through a symbiosis between AmbientTalk and Java, allowing the flexible, domain-specific language to use existing multithreaded components while maintaining the event-driven properties of the actor model. This approach bridges the gap between these two concurrency models and allows for more efficient and flexible programming.
411970	41197046	Automated Derivation of Translators From Annotated Grammars	This paper introduces a method for automating the creation of translators between operations languages, which are specialized programming languages used for satellite operations procedures. The technique utilizes annotated grammars to identify similarities between languages and create a transformation schema. Additionally, the paper suggests using an intermediate representation shared by all operations languages to further simplify the translation process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the authors semi-automatically generated translators between several operations languages using a prototype tool they developed.
411970	41197035	APPAREIL: A Tool for Building Automated Program Translators Using Annotated Grammars	Operations languages are essential for writing procedures for spacecraft operations. The APPAREIL tool simplifies the process of creating program translators between these languages by automatically generating them from annotated grammars. This partial translator covers most translations, but may require manual adjustments for more complex cases. To ensure the accuracy of the translation, the tool also includes a control-flow equivalence verification module. This helps to increase confidence in the correctness of the translation. Overall, the APPAREIL tool streamlines the process of creating program translators for operations languages, making it more efficient and accurate.
411970	41197040	Managing the evolution of aspect-oriented software with model-based pointcuts	Aspect-oriented programs, despite having advanced modularisation mechanisms, face evolution problems. The "fragile pointcut" issue can cause unexpected changes to the semantics of defined pointcuts when modifications are made to the base code. This can result in broken aspect functionality due to missed or unintended join points. To address this problem, we propose declaring pointcuts using a conceptual model of the base program instead of directly in terms of its structure. This effectively decouples pointcuts from the base program's structure and allows for verification of potential conflicts when the program evolves. To test our approach, we implemented a model-based pointcut mechanism on SmallWiki and successfully resolved fragile pointcut issues when the application evolved.
411971	41197134	Joint generative model for fMRI/DWI and its application to population studies.	The authors suggest a new approach to combine data from diffusion-weighted MRI tractography and resting-state functional MRI correlations using a probabilistic framework. This framework considers the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity patterns in the brain and can be applied to group studies. They use a mean-field approximation to fit the model to the data and observe significant differences in connectivity between normal controls and patients with schizophrenia. The proposed method provides a promising tool for investigating brain connectivity in various populations and has potential for further research in this area.
411971	41197145	Directional functions for orientation distribution estimation.	Computing the orientation distribution function (ODF) from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signals allows for determining the orientation of fiber bundles in the brain. Previous techniques used spherical harmonics or spherical radial basis functions, but this work introduces three new directional functions that require fewer parameters to represent the measured signals. These functions can also be used in mixture models to represent multiple fiber orientations. The framework is compared to using spherical harmonics on real and synthetic data, and its potential applications in tractography and segmentation are discussed.
411971	41197139	Sparse multi-shell diffusion imaging.	Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a non-invasive method for studying the structure and connectivity of the brain. Multi-shell imaging (MSI) is a type of dMRI that can provide valuable information about psychiatric and neurological disorders, but its use has been limited due to long acquisition times. This study proposes a method for reducing the number of gradient directions needed for a MSI scan using compressive sampling theory. The researchers developed a new basis for representing multi-shell signals and tested its effectiveness on synthetic and in-vivo data sets. Their preliminary results suggest that only 20-24 gradient directions per shell are needed for accurate reconstruction of the diffusion propagator. This could significantly reduce the acquisition time and make MSI more feasible for clinical use.
411972	41197266	Automatic Analysis of Programming Assignments	In a virtual university setting, there is a need for advanced support in handling assignments, especially homework assignments, due to the lack of face-to-face communication between teachers and students. In this paper, the AT(x) approach (analyze-and-test) is introduced as a way to automatically analyze and test programs. This approach is used to provide feedback to students working on programming exercises and is tailored to specific programming languages such as Prolog and Scheme. The AT(x) framework is further divided into AT(P) and AT(S) for programs written in Prolog and Scheme respectively. 
411972	41197233	Probabilistic knowledge representation using the principle of maximum entropy and Gröbner basis theory	The MaxEnt principle is a commonly used method for reasoning with probabilistic conditional knowledge bases. It aims to minimize the amount of assumed information and achieve unbiased results. This paper explores how MaxEnt distributions can be computed by solving nonlinear equation systems, using the theory of Gröbner bases. A three-phase compilation scheme is developed to extract crucial information from a knowledge base and transform it into a Gröbner basis. This allows for the derivation of necessary conditions for knowledge bases to be consistent and for answering MaxEnt queries. Computational methods for establishing general MaxEnt inference rules are also discussed. 
411972	41197235	Specification and correctness proof of a WAM extension with abstract type constraints	This paper presents a mathematical specification and correctness proof for a type-constraint extension of Warren's Abstract Machine (WAM) used for executing Prolog programs. The extension, called the PROTOS Abstract Machine (PAM), incorporates polymorphic order-sorted unification required by the logic programming language PROTOS-L. The paper focuses on the abstract representation of types and dynamic type constraints, allowing for flexibility in using different constraint formalisms. The extension is based on Börger's and Rosenzweig's formal derivation of the WAM, with a separate specification for the type-constraint handling component. The correctness of the extension is proven through a series of refinement steps. The paper concludes that any compiler to the WAM extension with an abstract notion of types that satisfies the specified conditions is correct for all abstract type-constraint logic programming systems.

ACMI helps identify potential errors or discrepancies in the invoices, leading to more efficient and effective processing. It also provides transparency and traceability in the decision-making process. Overall, ACMI serves as a valuable tool for the health insurance company in managing and verifying medical invoices.
411973	41197350	Angerona - A Flexible Multiagent Framework for Knowledge-Based Agents.	The Angerona framework is designed for creating knowledge-based agents that are flexible, extensible, and compatible with different knowledge representation methods. It introduces the concept of compound agents, which consist of hierarchies of interacting epistemic and functional components. Different knowledge representation formalisms can be used within one agent and different agents in the same system can have different architectures. This framework is implemented through a flexible JAVA plug-in architecture and utilizes the Tweety library for knowledge representation. It also includes an environment plug-in for communication between agents and a user-friendly GUI for monitoring the system. Angerona and Tweety are open source and well documented for easy use.
411973	4119733	A case study on the application of probabilistic conditional modelling and reasoning to clinical patient data in neurosurgery	This study describes the use of probabilistic logic in analyzing clinical patient data in neurosurgery. The researchers utilized probabilistic conditionals to create a knowledge base that incorporated both clinical brain tumor data and expert knowledge from physicians. By using the principle of maximum entropy, the most unbiased probability distribution was chosen to represent the data. The MEcore system was used to compute this maximum entropy distribution and also provided various knowledge management operations such as revising, updating, and querying the knowledge base. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated through the use of MEcore's knowledge management operations.

411974	41197441	Tutorial H2: an overview of UML 2.0	This tutorial provides an overview of the significant changes in the first major update of the Unified Modeling Language, UML 2.0. It includes the reasons behind these changes and the perspective of one of the main designers. The structure of UML 2.0 is explained, along with a more in-depth look at the new modeling features and their applications through examples.

411974	4119740	On the Semantic Foundations of Standard UML 2.0	This paper discusses the foundations of the run-time semantics of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as defined in revision 2.0 of the official OMG standard. The standard has been criticized for being difficult to understand due to the scattered information about semantics. This has led to misconceptions that UML has little or no semantic content. The paper aims to provide a clear and concise description of the structure and essential content of UML runtime semantics, making it a useful starting point for researchers working on the problem of UML semantics. It is particularly helpful for those interested in creating formal models of these semantics. 
411975	41197530	Application of paraconsistent logic in an intelligent tutoring system	It has been observed that testing students' understanding of new concepts immediately after they are introduced greatly enhances the learning process. The measure of understanding is based on the student's ability to provide accurate answers to questions that require the application of the concept. One solution to determining the level of understanding is to administer tests, which can provide information to intelligent agents and aid in evaluating tests. However, factors such as time and the formulation of questions can greatly affect a student's understanding. To address this, the use of paraconsistent logic is proposed as classical logic is unable to draw conclusions in the presence of inconsistencies.
411975	4119754	Knowledge Assessment Based on Many-Valued Logic	This paper discusses the use of six-valued logic in an assessment component of an intelligent tutoring system. This enables the system to handle situations where input is incomplete or inconsistent. The focus is on the decision making rules used by the intelligent agent to assess students' understanding of new terms. If the assessment is not connected to grading, the system does not use penalty rules to discourage misuse. Instead, rules are implemented to differentiate between students' hesitation in answering and lack of knowledge. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the student's understanding.
411975	41197552	On drawing conclusions in presence of inconsistent data	Automated tests used to assess student understanding typically have one question that requires the application of a specific concept. To improve the accuracy of evaluations, it is suggested to have a test with three different questions that require the application of the same concept. This type of test can aid in self-assessment and can be given to students after they have been introduced to a concept. Lattice theory and higher-order logic can be used to create a structure for an intelligent tutoring system. This structure can be used as a foundation for building a system that can help students learn and apply concepts more effectively.
411976	41197652	A fractional approach for the motion planning of redundant and hyper-redundant manipulators	This paper introduces a new approach to address the issue of drift in joint space trajectory planning for redundant robots, using a fractional differential of order @a. Two performance measures, positional error index and repeatability performance index, are defined to evaluate the effectiveness of this method. The results of testing on redundant and hyper-redundant planar manipulators show that a wide range of values for @a can achieve repetitive joint trajectories. This technique offers a solution to the problem of drift in joint space trajectory planning for redundant robots.
411976	41197649	Maximin Spreading Algorithm	This paper introduces a genetic algorithm that can effectively optimize uni-objective problems with an infinite number of optimal solutions. The algorithm utilizes the maximin concept and epsilon-dominance to promote diversity in the solution space. It is tested on two well-known functions and produces results that closely match the optimal solutions. The algorithm is also applied to two real-world engineering optimization problems, resulting in a set of optimal solutions for each problem. This demonstrates the algorithm's ability to find multiple ways to solve a problem with equal maximum performance. Overall, the proposed optimization method shows promising results for tackling complex problems with a large number of optimal solutions.
411976	41197640	Multi-objective maximin sorting scheme	This paper presents a new approach to improving the distribution of non-dominated Pareto fronts in multi-objective optimization algorithms. The proposed method modifies the elitist selection operator in the NSGA-II algorithm by replacing the crowding distance method with a maximin technique. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated on several test functions and compared to the traditional NSGA-II algorithm using distance performance indices. The results show that the proposed technique leads to a better distribution of solutions on the Pareto front. This suggests that it can be a useful tool for improving the quality of solutions in multi-objective optimization problems.
411977	41197739	A Quantitative Analysis of Current Practices in Optical Flow Estimation and the Principles Behind Them	Optical flow estimation algorithms have improved significantly, but the basic formulation has remained unchanged since the work of Horn and Schunck. Researchers have analyzed the impact of the objective function, optimization method, and implementation practices on accuracy. Surprisingly, classical methods perform well when combined with modern techniques such as median filtering during optimization. However, this leads to higher energy solutions and does not optimize the original objective function. To address this, a new objective function is developed that includes a non-local smoothness term and information about flow and image boundaries. An asymmetric pyramid downsampling scheme is also introduced to better estimate long-range horizontal motions. The methods are evaluated on various datasets and show promising results.
411977	41197713	A Database and Evaluation Methodology for Optical Flow	In 1994, Barron et al. conducted a quantitative evaluation of optical flow algorithms, which greatly improved their performance. However, current challenges for these algorithms extend beyond the datasets and evaluation methods proposed in that study. These challenges include nonrigid motion, sensor noise, and motion discontinuities in complex natural scenes. To address these issues, the authors propose a new set of benchmarks and evaluation methods, including four types of data to test different aspects of optical flow algorithms. These include sequences with nonrigid motion, realistic synthetic sequences, high frame-rate video, and modified stereo sequences. In 2007, the authors published the performance of several methods on their preliminary data, and since then, more researchers have used the data and shown significant improvements in performance. In this paper, the authors analyze these results and draw conclusions.
411977	41197711	Discrete-Continuous Optimization for Optical Flow Estimation	Optical flow estimation is a challenging task that involves minimizing energy functions. Most successful methods use continuous optimization algorithms and assume convex models to make the problem more manageable. However, in narrow-baseline stereo matching, non-convex energies are optimized using discrete algorithms. This chapter introduces a method that combines discrete and continuous techniques to optimize non-convex energies in optical flow estimation. It starts with candidate solutions from fast continuous algorithms or sparse feature matching and then uses minimum cuts on graphs to fuse them. The resulting continuous-valued solution is further improved using local gradient descent. Experiments show that this approach not only produces accurate results, but also outperforms traditional discrete or continuous optimization methods.
411978	41197860	The impact of continuous integration on other software development practices: a large-scale empirical study.	Continuous Integration (CI) has brought about significant changes in the software development process. With the right tools and implementation, it has been proven to positively impact pull request throughput and the ability to handle larger projects. However, like any new innovation, adopting CI requires adapting existing practices and implementing "best practices" for maximum benefit. A study was conducted on the adoption and evolution of code writing, submission, issue and pull request closing, and testing practices as Travis CI was adopted by established projects on GitHub. A survey of GitHub developers was also conducted to gain insight into their experiences with adopting CI. The results suggest a more nuanced understanding of how GitHub teams are adapting to and utilizing CI technology compared to previous research.
411978	41197867	A Data Set for Social Diversity Studies of GitHub Teams	The software development process is influenced by social diversity within programming teams, just like any other team-oriented activity. The impact of diversity can be significant, but it is complex, especially in decentralized teams. To fully understand the effects of diversity on team effectiveness, quantitative studies using large data sets are necessary. This article introduces a data set of 23,493 GitHub projects that includes social diversity attributes of programmers, such as location and gender. The authors demonstrate how this data set can be used to study diversity in software teams through case studies, and they hope it will encourage further research in this area. 
411978	41197858	How social Q&A sites are changing knowledge sharing in open source software communities	Mailing lists have traditionally been the preferred method for coordinating development and user support, but the rise of social Q&A sites like StackOverflow has caused a shift. These sites offer different incentives for participants, such as collaborative content management and showcasing expertise. One key difference is the use of gamification, where participants compete for reputation points and badges. A study of the R community found that many experts are migrating from traditional mailing lists to StackOverflow, where they are more active and provide faster answers. This is the first study to directly examine the behavior changes of specific contributors as they move to gamified environments, and has implications for knowledge management in software engineering.

The system utilizes third party linguistic analyzers and builds upon previous work in web information extraction and fuzzy inductive logic programming. The main contributions of the paper include formal models, a prototype implementation of the system, and evaluation experiments. The system shows promise in accurately classifying web reports and has potential for practical applications. 
411979	41197936	Induction of Fuzzy and Annotated Logic Programs	The current focus of research in data mining is on developing methods to handle imperfection, such as uncertainty and imprecision. This involves a heavy emphasis on probability models, as well as studying imperfection in fuzzy logic. Specifically, the paper discusses fuzzy logic programs (FLP) and Generalized Annotated Programs (GAP) and proposes a formal model for fuzzy inductive logic programming (FILP) and induction of GAP programs (IGAP). The lack of a standardized proof-theoretic approach in FILP is addressed, and a new method for learning from entailment in IGAP is described. This approach is applied to detecting user preferences in a web search application, and is compared to other fuzzy ILP methods.
411979	41197923	Linguistic Extraction for Semantic Annotation	The lack of semantically annotated information is a bottleneck for semantic web services. To address this issue, a method is proposed in this paper that utilizes existing linguistic tools originally created for the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT 2.0) corpus. The system captures web-page text, annotates it linguistically using PDT tools, and extracts data to store in an ontology. The focus is on data extraction and methods for learning queries over linguistically annotated data are presented. Experiments in the domain of traffic accident reports show the potential for summarizing data, serving as proof of concept for the solution. Future plans include conducting more experiments in different domains to improve third party semantic annotation of web resources.
411980	41198061	Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Programming: To Ordinary Differential Equations and Back	This paper focuses on the relationship between models of biological systems using ordinary differential equations (ODE) and models using stochastic and concurrent constraint programming (sCCP). The authors propose a method to convert between the two types of models and investigate their properties. They show that the conversion from sCCP to ODE's preserves rate semantics for biochemical models and study the invertibility of the mappings. They also examine the preservation of dynamics in the models obtained through the mappings, providing a convergence theorem in the direction from ODE's to sCCP. Several examples are discussed in detail to show that dynamics may not be preserved in the inverse direction. 
411980	41198020	Hybrid dynamics of stochastic programs	Stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming (sCCP) is a process algebra based on CCP that has a hybrid automaton semantics. Each sCCP program is associated with both a stochastic and a non-deterministic hybrid automaton. These automata are compared to the standard stochastic semantics given by a Continuous Time Markov Chain and the one based on ordinary differential equations, which is obtained through a fluid-flow approximation technique. Two case studies, Repressilator and the Circadian Clock, are discussed in detail, focusing on the robustness of different semantic models and the impact of discreteness on the system's dynamics.
411980	41198038	The Importance of Being (A Little Bit) Discrete	This article discusses the hybrid, stochastic, and differential semantics used in stochastic Concurrent Constraint Programming and examines their respective behaviors and robustness. Two case studies, a circadian clock model and the Repressilator, are analyzed to demonstrate the impact of introducing discreteness in the description of biological systems using hybrid automata. The results suggest that incorporating discreteness can improve the robustness of these models.
411981	41198111	A Delay-Based Piggryback Scheme In Ieee 802.11	Data frames can be combined with control frames to improve channel efficiency in wireless communication. However, this piggyback scheme can lead to decreased efficiency and increased frame transmission delay for other stations with low transmission rates. This is similar to the anomaly phenomenon in multi-rate transmission networks. To address this issue, a delay-based piggyback algorithm is proposed, which considers the delay efficiency in IEEE 802.11 WLAN when deciding whether to use the piggyback scheme for a control frame. Simulation results show that this algorithm can reduce average frame delay and channel utilization by approximately 24% and 25%, respectively, even when there is one station with a low transmission rate. 
411981	41198148	Beamforming strategy using adaptive beam patterns and power control for common control channel in hierarchical cell structure networks	Beamforming techniques have been successful in solving interference problems for traffic channels, but their use for control channels has not been thoroughly researched. A new (semi-) centralized beamforming strategy is proposed for hierarchical cell structure (HCS) networks, which adapts beam patterns and controls transmit power to enhance the performance of the common channel. This strategy is demonstrated through examples in two-tier HCS networks, consisting of macro and pico cells, with low complexity. System-level simulations show that this strategy provides a significant improvement compared to random beamforming and conventional systems that do not use the proposed algorithm. The proposed scheme can be applied to multiple adjacent cells, even if it is initially designed for the pico cell. The performance metric used is the cumulative distribution function of user geometry or channel quality, as the number of outage users is more important for the common control channel than the sum rate.
411981	41198132	Performance modeling and evaluation of data/voice services in wireless networks	The success of CDMA2000 depends heavily on application-level performance. To accurately predict this performance, a comprehensive simulation model is built to consider application traffic, network architecture, and network element details. Different transport architectures, such as ATM and IP, are evaluated in terms of user-perceived voice service quality and data packet performance. Results show that the vocoder bypass scenario and the use of DPS scheduling significantly improve voice service quality. For data packets, HTTP v.1.1 performs better than v.1.0 due to pipelining and TCP persistent connection. In terms of overall performance, IP is found to be a better solution for higher error rate environments, while 3G-1X EV-DO outperforms 3G-1X RTT. It is concluded that all aspects of the network must be considered to achieve optimal application-level performance.
411982	41198227	Shape-Simplifying Image Abstraction	This paper presents an algorithm for creating stylistic abstractions of photographs. The method uses mean curvature flow and shock filter to simplify shapes and colors while preserving important features. A constrained mean curvature flow is also developed to better convey directionality and shape boundaries. The algorithm is iterative and allows for intuitive control over the level of abstraction. Users can also incorporate masking to control the speed of abstraction and protect certain regions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method produces highly abstract and feature-preserving illustrations from photographs. 
411982	41198262	Intrinsic Image Decomposition Using Structure-Texture Separation And Surface Normals	Intrinsic image decomposition is a complex problem that has been extensively studied for many years, but it still presents challenges. This is due to commonly used constraints being too restrictive to accurately capture the rich textures present in natural images. In this paper, a new image model is proposed that effectively handles textures in decomposition, even with simple constraints. Additionally, a new constraint is introduced that utilizes surface normals from an RGB-D image to promote consistency in the shading layer. This constraint is based on a locally linear embedding framework and is effective for Lambertian surfaces. The combination of this new image model and constraint outperforms existing approaches in producing high quality results.
411982	41198276	Fast motion deblurring	This paper introduces a fast deblurring method that can produce a high-quality result from a single image in just a few seconds. The method speeds up the process by using image derivatives instead of pixel values and incorporating a prediction step to estimate the latent image and the kernel. This allows for a more efficient Gaussian prior to be used for deconvolution and reduces the number of Fourier transforms needed for optimization. The paper also demonstrates that the method is significantly faster than previous methods and can be implemented on a GPU for even faster results. Experimental results show that the deblurring quality is comparable to previous methods.
411983	4119831	Generating counterexamples of model-based software product lines.	A model-based software product line (MSPL) uses a variability model to capture the differences in a domain and base models to represent the core artifacts. Realization models connect the features in the variability model to the base model elements and trigger operations based on a configuration. However, managing the design space of an MSPL can be extremely complex for engineers due to the large number of variants and the need for conformity to rules. To address this, the paper proposes using counterexamples (or antipatterns) to identify invalid product models, which can help in creating guidelines and testing oracles. A generic process using the common variability language (CVL) is provided to randomly search for MSPLs, and a tool called LineGen is developed to support this process. The effectiveness of this approach is validated with different formalisms and in an industrial scenario.
411983	41198355	Extraction and evolution of architectural variability models in plugin-based systems	Variability management is crucial in building and updating software systems, allowing them to be tailored to individual customers and deployment contexts. This is often achieved through extensible systems with numerous configuration options provided by plugins. In an ideal scenario, a software architect can easily generate a specific system variant by selecting the necessary plugins. To achieve this, variation points and constraints must be properly modeled and maintained over time. However, this is a challenging and time-consuming task. In this article, the authors propose a reverse engineering process to create a feature model of a plugin-based architecture. This approach utilizes automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions, including a software architecture model, plugin dependencies, and the software architect's knowledge. By analyzing differences between versions of architectural feature models, the approach allows for effective control of both the extraction and evolution of variability. The proposed process was successfully applied to a large-scale system and the authors share their experience in this context.
411983	41198351	Assessing product line derivation operators applied to Java source code: an empirical study	Product Derivation is an important part of Software Product Line Engineering where operators modify or create core assets to create a new derived product. These operators can result in either valid or invalid products, making it challenging to determine which ones to use. This paper addresses this challenge by empirically analyzing which operators, applied to different program elements, can generate correct, incorrect, or conforming variants of programs. Using the Common Variability Language, the study synthesizes over 370,000 program variants from 8 real large Java projects, providing insights into the effectiveness of these operators. 
411984	41198418	Towards a more semantically transparent i* visual syntax	The i* modelling language is commonly used in Requirements Engineering to facilitate communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. However, recent research has revealed flaws in its visual syntax, which can affect the effectiveness of model-mediated communication. In this paper, the focus is on one specific quality criterion, Semantic Transparency, which refers to the ability of notation symbols to convey their meaning. The authors propose an empirical approach to address this issue and present a series of experiments aimed at identifying a new symbol set for i* and evaluating its semantic transparency. While this work does not solve all problems in the i* notation, it serves as an important step towards creating visually effective requirements modelling languages. The authors suggest that this approach can be applied to other quality criteria and other notations in the future.
411984	41198493	Discovering sustainability requirements: an experience report	The concept of sustainability has become a major concern for our society, and the design and use of software-intensive systems plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. However, current software requirements engineering practices do not specifically address sustainability requirements, unlike other quality requirements such as security and usability. This paper discusses a software project where sustainability requirements were given equal importance and systematically identified, analyzed, and documented. The authors aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing techniques in supporting these activities. This experience highlights the need for more attention to be given to sustainability concerns in requirements engineering and suggests that even small steps can lead to more sustainable systems. It also provides valuable insights for researchers in the field of requirements engineering and sustainability.
411984	4119844	What's in a feature: a requirements engineering perspective	The concept of "feature" is widely used in Software Engineering, particularly in software product lines. However, it can be confusing as it combines different aspects of the problem and solution. In this paper, the authors aim to clarify the meaning of feature by using Zave and Jackson's framework for Requirements Engineering. They redefine a problem-level feature as a collection of related requirements, specifications, and domain assumptions. This approach also allows for a better understanding of feature interaction and can aid in the formal description and verification of software product lines. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through a prototype tool and application to a Smart Home example.
411985	41198552	Extraction and evolution of architectural variability models in plugin-based systems	Variability management is an important aspect in building and updating software systems, allowing for customization and adaptation to meet customers' needs and deployment contexts. Extensible software systems, built on plugin-based architectures, offer a wide range of configuration options through plugins. To efficiently generate system variants, the software architect must accurately model the variation points and constraints between architectural elements. This task can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this article, a reverse engineering process is proposed to produce a variability model of a plugin-based architecture. This involves automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions, such as a hierarchical software architecture model, plugin dependency model, and software architect knowledge. By analyzing differences between versions of architectural feature models, the software architect can control the variability extraction and evolution processes. The approach has been successfully applied to a large-scale plugin-based system, FraSCAti, with different versions of its architecture.
411985	41198538	Early Consistency Checking Between Specification And Implementation Variabilities	The software product line (SPL) engineering approach requires consistency between the specified variability and the core-code assets. However, current support for checking this consistency is limited, especially when multiple variability implementation techniques are used. This can lead to variability inconsistencies, which can be detected early in the development process through the proposed method. This method models implemented variability using variation points and variants and uses slicing to check for inconsistencies between specification and implementation levels. The approach has been successfully applied in four case studies and is available for public use, providing a quick and automated way to ensure consistency in the development process.
411985	41198536	FAMILIAR: A domain-specific language for large scale management of feature models	The feature model formalism is widely used for managing variability in software product lines. However, this process can be tedious and prone to errors when dealing with a large number of features. In response to this, FAMILIAR, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), has been developed to complement existing tools and address the challenges of feature modeling. FAMILIAR allows for the separation of concerns through composition and decomposition operators, reasoning capabilities, and scripting with modularization mechanisms. The effectiveness of FAMILIAR is demonstrated through its use in managing a medical imaging services product line, as well as its applicability to different domains and purposes. 
411986	41198625	NAP: practical fault-tolerance for itinerant computations	Mobile agents can be used to support itinerant computation, which is a program that moves from host to host in a network. The program can have a pre-defined itinerary or dynamically compute the next host to visit. It can also create multiple copies of itself on a single host and visit the same host repeatedly. However, this type of computation is vulnerable to failures such as processor failures, communications failures, and program bugs. To address this, NAP is a protocol that uses failure detection and recovery to provide fault tolerance for itinerant computations. NAP is implemented in TACOMA and offers guarantees for its effectiveness.
411986	41198631	Efficient detection of a class of stable properties	This article presents a protocol for detecting a type of stable property, called locally stable properties, in distributed systems. The protocol utilizes a decentralized approach to construct a subset of local states that are mutually consistent, using a modified version of vector time stamps. The protocol is adaptable and can be refined for specialized property detection, and has been proven to be efficient through the derivation of two existing protocols. 
411986	41198651	Gossip versus Deterministically Constrained Flooding on Small Networks	Rumor mongering, or gossip, is a method of spreading information that is highly reliable and scalable. It is able to adapt well to failures and has a reliable degradation with increasing failures. However, its use of random selection for communication has been studied and a new deterministic protocol has been developed. This new protocol has similar benefits to rumor mongering, but with a higher cost in terms of message sent. A comparison between the two approaches has been made both abstractly and in terms of performance in Ethernet and small wide area networks.
411987	41198720	A hybrid intelligent algorithm for solving the bilevel programming models	This paper presents a hybrid intelligent algorithm that combines genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN) to solve bilevel programming models. GA is used to select potential combinations, while a meta-controlled Boltzmann machine (consisting of a Hopfield network and a Boltzmann machine) determines the optimal solution. The algorithm is applied to solve two-level investment problems, where the upper layer determines optimal company investments and the lower layer decides optimal department investments. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of this method.

The neural network is formulated using a meta-controlled Boltzmann machine, which combines the Hopfield model and the Boltzmann machine. Numerical experiments show that this approach is effective in solving quadratic bilevel programming problems.
411987	411987135	New Perspective for Structural Learning Method of Neural Networks	A neural network is a technology that mimics the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of units and links that connect between units. There are two main types of neural networks: back-propagation hierarchical neural networks and mutual-connected neural networks. However, determining the optimal number of units for a neural network can be difficult and is often based on expert experience. This paper introduces a learning method called structural learning, which helps determine the best structure for a neural network to solve problems. The paper focuses on explaining the use of structural learning for both hierarchical and mutual-connected neural networks and presents successful results in both cases. This research also demonstrates the potential for optimizing neural networks through structured learning, which can improve their practicality and reduce the cost of operation and system maintenance.

The use of real-time intraoperative image guidance has opened up new possibilities for surgical interventions, such as image-guided robot assistance. However, current methods only allow for visual perception during the procedure. This study introduces a framework for performing robot-assisted interventions with real-time MRI guidance. The framework processes the MRI data in real-time and integrates it with robot control, providing a visualization and force-feedback interface for the operator. Experimental results show that this approach significantly improves the speed, accuracy, and safety of procedures, reducing the duration and incidents of tissue collisions. 
411988	41198818	Visual and force-feedback guidance for robot-assisted interventions in the beating heart with real-time MRI	Robot-assisted surgical procedures are constantly improving in order to provide better patient treatment and reduce healthcare costs. One way to enhance these procedures is by incorporating real-time imaging during surgery, which can provide crucial information for the operator. In this study, a guidance approach was developed that uses real-time MRI to assist with robot-assisted procedures in a beating heart. This approach offers both visualization and force-feedback guidance to safely maneuver an interventional tool in the dynamic environment of the heart's left ventricle. Testing on a simulated scenario of transapical aortic valve replacement showed improved control and manipulation, providing effective and accurate assistance to the operator in real-time.
411988	4119889	Generation of 4d access corridors from real-time multislice MRI for guiding transapical aortic valvuloplasties	Real-time image-guided cardiac procedures, whether manual or robot-assisted, are becoming more popular due to their potential to improve patient management and reduce costs. These minimally invasive procedures require real-time visualization and guidance to safely maneuver an interventional tool inside the constantly moving heart. In this study, researchers propose a method to generate dynamic 4D access corridors for real-time MRI-guided transapical valvuloplasties. By processing ultrafast MR images collected every 49.3 ms, a conservative dynamic trace is extracted to create a 3D access corridor. Experimental results demonstrate that these corridors can be updated with a delay of less than 0.5 ms to account for changes in the heart caused by breathing and heartbeat.

These devices use classification algorithms to detect specific events in real-time. However, selecting the right features for these algorithms is important to ensure efficient use of resources and accurate detection of critical events. In this paper, a power-aware feature selection method is proposed to minimize energy consumption in classification applications. This approach takes into consideration the energy cost of individual features and uses a graph model to represent their correlation and computing complexity. The problem is formulated using integer programming and a greedy approximation is presented to select features in a power-efficient manner. Experimental results show significant energy savings of over 30 percent while maintaining high classification accuracy. 
411989	41198940	A wireless communication selection approach to minimize energy-per-bit for wearable computing applications	Body Sensor Networks (BSN) offer a way to continuously monitor human movements, improving medical care and enabling remote patient monitoring. However, BSNs face challenges in terms of wearability, with battery size having a significant impact. To address this, a burst communication technique is proposed in this paper, utilizing data buffering to reduce energy-per-bit cost and allowing for larger packet sizes or more efficient communication schemes. An energy model is developed to optimize the transmission schedule, taking into account both signal processing requirements and task deadlines. The proposed approach is demonstrated in sway monitoring BSN applications, showing a significant improvement in energy cost compared to traditional streaming methods. Results also highlight the relationship between task deadline extension and energy cost. 
411989	41198916	Energy-efficient signal processing in wearable embedded systems: an optimal feature selection approach	Wearable embedded systems often use classification algorithms to map physiological signal features to different user states, such as health status or activity type. However, traditional feature selection methods can drain the battery quickly due to a lack of consideration for computing complexity. This paper proposes a power-aware feature selection approach that considers the energy cost of individual features in real-time. The problem is solved using integer programming and a greedy approximation, resulting in a significant reduction in energy consumption (over 30%) while maintaining high classification accuracy (96.7%). This approach has potential for improving the energy efficiency of wearable devices.
411990	41199031	Zero-Effort Camera-Assisted Calibration Techniques for Wearable Motion Sensors	Activity recognition using wearable motion sensors is crucial for monitoring health and wellness. However, these algorithms are designed to work with a specific orientation of the sensors on the body. If the sensors are accidentally displaced, it is important to recalibrate their new location and orientation. Traditionally, this requires the user to perform specific movements or manually input information about sensor placement. In this paper, the authors propose a camera-assisted calibration method that eliminates the need for extra effort from the user. The calibration occurs seamlessly when the user appears in front of a camera and performs any activity of their choice. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach.
411990	41199079	Impact of sensor misplacement on dynamic time warping based human activity recognition using wearable computers	Monitoring daily activities is crucial for detecting diseases early and improving the quality of life, especially for the elderly. A network of wireless wearable sensors can track daily motions and provide a continuous stream of data for activity recognition. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a commonly used method for pattern matching in time-series data, known for its robustness to variations in time and speed. However, for activity recognition, DTW is limited in its ability to handle changes in sensor location and orientation. This can result in decreased accuracy if sensors are misplaced. To address this, the study uses a marker-based motion capture system to simulate different sensor configurations and assess the worst-case scenarios for sensor misplacement. This research aims to improve the performance of DTW for real-time detection of daily activities, such as sit-to-stand movements.
411990	41199073	Data-Driven Synchronization for Internet-of-Things Systems.	The Internet of Things (IoT) is driven by the increase of sensors, actuators, and services that gather and analyze raw sensor data. Wearable and environmental sensors will play a significant role in the IoT, providing information about people and their activities. Synchronization of sensors is crucial for maximizing the usefulness and value of the data and allowing for comparison across multiple sources. However, due to the variety of sensors, synchronization can be challenging. This article presents new methods for synchronizing data from multiple sensors by analyzing sensor events and interactions. These techniques can improve synchronization accuracy and have been validated through experiments with wearable and environmental sensors. Results showed a significant reduction in error for sensors synchronized through physical interactions.
411991	41199145	The minimum number of triangles in graphs of given order and size.	In the 1940s and 50s, Erdős and Rademacher posed the question of finding the maximum number of triangles in a graph with a given number of vertices and edges. This problem has been studied extensively and was recently solved by Razborov in 2008. Further developments by Nikiforov and Reiher have led to an exact solution for large graphs with edge density not approaching one. This result confirms a conjecture made by Lovasz and Simonovits in 1975 for almost all cases. 
411991	41199111	Coloring d-Embeddable k-Uniform Hypergraphs.	This paper explores the Four Color Theorem in relation to hypergraphs, specifically those that can be embedded into \(\mathbb {R}^d\). The maximum chromatic number of these hypergraphs is investigated, with lower and upper bounds being determined. It is shown that for \(d\ge 3\), there are hypergraphs in \(\fancyscript{H}_{2d-3,d}\) with a chromatic number of \(\Omega (\log n/\log \log n)\), while for hypergraphs in \(\fancyscript{H}_{d,d}\) with \(n\) vertices, the chromatic number is bounded by \({\mathcal {O}}(n^{(d-2)/(d-1)})\). 
411991	41199155	How complex are random graphs in first order logic?	A first order formula can be written to accurately describe a given graph, but not any other graph that is not isomorphic to it. The complexity of the graph can be measured by the minimum number of nested quantifiers needed in the formula, denoted as D(G). The study of D(G) for random graphs shows that when the edge probability is constant, D(G) is of order log n. For very sparse graphs, D(G) is approximately &THgr;(n), while for certain values of p it can be as slow growing as log&ast; n. Overall, the general relationship between D(G) and random graphs is not fully understood. 
411992	41199241	Testing in context: framework and test derivation	The paper discusses the challenge of testing a component within a modular system. The component's "context" is defined as the rest of the system, which serves as its operational or testing environment. The authors propose a framework for testing in context using a model of communicating finite state machines. They address the issues of test executability and fault propagation in the presence of the context by computing an approximation of the component's specification. This approximation allows for tests to be executed and faults to be propagated through the context. The paper also presents a conformance relation for test derivation, based on the reduction relation between an implementation and the approximation of the specification. The authors also provide an approach for test generation in the case of deterministic implementations.

This helps to reduce design costs and errors by defining the communication between application components. The paper proposes a new synthesis method that uses extended Petri nets and an integer linear programming model to generate optimized protocol specifications. This model considers various cost criteria such as the number and size of messages, frequency of execution, communication channel costs, and resource placement costs. An application example is provided, along with experimental results. This approach can be applied to various application areas to minimize communication costs and improve overall efficiency. 
411992	41199255	Testing for a Conformance Relation Based on Acceptance	The object-oriented paradigm has gained popularity, but there is limited research on how to test object-oriented software systems. This paper proposes a conformance testing method for these systems, taking into account special features like inheritance. The method uses a modified version of the acceptance tree model to test the conformance relation and allows for testing whether an object instance implementation adheres to a given class specification. This can be done by applying test cases derived from the class specification to the implementation, under certain assumptions. This method highlights the importance of considering unique programming features in the testing phase of object-oriented software systems.

The system uses strong encryption and digital signatures to ensure the security of the data as it travels through the internet. The paper describes the public key infrastructure and the changes made to the web interface to suit the opticians' needs. The results of pilot testing and feedback from opticians are also discussed. The authors found that a well-designed system with a seamless PKI can improve patient care and data quality, but slow internet speeds and difficulty in creating a user-friendly interface can be challenges. They also highlight the importance of maintaining all components and administrative procedures to ensure the system's availability.
411993	41199317	Obligations Of Trust For Privacy And Confidentiality In Distributed Transactions	This paper introduces the concept of the obligation of trust (OoT) protocol, which aims to enhance privacy and authorization in distributed transactions. The protocol allows two parties to dynamically exchange their privacy and authorization requirements and commitments, promoting a more user-centric and symmetric approach to privacy protection. The authors demonstrate the applicability of the OoT protocol in various scenarios and highlight its potential to improve upon existing mechanisms. By providing digitally signed acceptance of obligations messages, the protocol also strengthens legal protection for parties involved in a dispute. This paper contributes to current research in trust negotiation, privacy protection, and authorization by combining these three elements into a standardized protocol.

Users are shown a list of their accounts based on their identity attributes, and can upload and download files. They can also grant access to their files to others in the federated system, regardless of their previous use of the cloud service. The system uses standard identity management protocols, access controls, and a delegation service. APIs have been defined for authentication, authorization, and delegation, and the software is open source. A public demo of the system is available online.
411994	41199431	Subjectively Interesting Component Analysis: Data Projections that Contrast with Prior Expectations	High-dimensional data can be difficult to explore without effective low-dimensional projections. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used method for finding such projections, as it is simple and often captures the most relevant structure in the data. However, not all users may find the dominant structure interesting. To address this, a new method called Subjectively Interesting Component Analysis (SICA) has been introduced. This method uses information theory and a user's prior expectations to find projections that are truly surprising and interesting. The optimization problem is straightforward and results in a balance between explained variance and novelty.

Deriving insights from high-dimensional data is a challenging task in data mining due to the large number of variable combinations to consider. Can this search for interesting patterns be automated? In this study, the focus is on learning efficiently about real-valued attributes. A method is proposed to identify subgroups in the data that are highly informative, using the Subjective Interestingness framework FORSIED. These informative subgroups are described using a range of attribute types and are selected based on their maximization of information with respect to one or more target attributes. This approach allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in the search for the most informative patterns.
411994	41199438	An information theoretic framework for data mining	The data mining process is formalized as a process of information exchange, with the data miner's state of mind represented as a probability distribution called the background distribution. This distribution incorporates prior beliefs and is updated as patterns in the data are revealed to the data miner. The framework is motivated by information theory and game theory, and can be extended to account for noise and errors in the data. It uses concepts from information geometry and I-projections to model the data mining process, and can aid in designing more efficient data mining algorithms.

The system collects and annotates a large amount of textual data, allowing for the extraction of trends and patterns. The study focuses on 3.5 million news articles and identifies a relationship between their topics, gender bias, and readability. This demonstrates the potential for pattern analysis technology to automate tasks typically done by humans in the social sciences, making large-scale studies possible. 
411995	41199556	Modelling and predicting news popularity	In this study, the problem of predicting the popularity of online news articles is explored. Instead of simply classifying articles as popular or unpopular, the concept of popularity is viewed as a competitive situation where the most appealing articles are considered popular. A linear function is used to model this appeal, and is learned from a training set of popular and non-popular articles from various news outlets. The method is able to accurately predict which articles will become popular and identify keywords that influence the appeal function. This approach allows for comparison of reader preferences among different news outlets using limited information such as article content, publication date, and popularity status.
411995	41199530	Automatic discovery of patterns in media content	The automation of scientific inquiry and scholarship is becoming increasingly prevalent in the social sciences and humanities. Recent articles have highlighted the use of pattern analysis techniques to uncover relationships in datasets relevant to these fields, leading to the emergence of "Computational Social Sciences" and "Culturomics." The Intelligent Systems Laboratory in Bristol has been conducting research in automating the analysis of news media content using pattern recognition, data mining, and language technologies. This is a crucial area of study due to the significant influence of the global news system on public opinion, markets, and culture. With the availability of vast amounts of online news content, it is now possible to use automated methods to monitor patterns on a large scale. The results of this research demonstrate the potential for detecting macro-patterns that were previously unseen and the benefits of collaboration between the social sciences and the research communities of pattern analysis, artificial intelligence, and text mining.
411996	41199653	Automating Customisation of Floating-Point Designs	This paper presents a method for customizing the representation of floating-point numbers using re-configurable hardware. The method determines the appropriate size of the mantissa and exponent for each operation, in order to satisfy a cost function with a specified error compared to a reference representation. The implementation of this method is iterative and supports IEEE single-precision or double-precision floating-point representation as the reference. This tool can produce custom floating-point formats with varying sizes of mantissa and exponent, and can be applied to different arithmetic representations and hardware designs. The results demonstrate that this method can improve the speed and size of hardware for calculations with large dynamic ranges compared to using the reference representation. 
411996	41199674	Automating custom-precision function evaluation for embedded processors	Embedded processors often lack dedicated floating-point units due to resource and power limitations. This results in slow operation when floating-point arithmetic is needed, such as with the IBM PowerPC processor in Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs. To address this issue, a customizable mathematical library using fixed-point arithmetic for elementary function evaluation has been developed. The library approximates functions using polynomial or rational approximations based on user-defined accuracy requirements. The input and output data are compatible with IEEE single-precision and double-precision floating-point formats. Tests show that the 32-bit polynomial method offers 80 times faster performance than the Xilinx single-precision library, while the 64-bit method offers 30 times faster performance.
411996	41199668	Dual Fixed-Point: An Efficient Alternative to Floating-Point Computation	DFX is a new data representation that combines features of both fixed-point and floating-point systems. It uses a single bit exponent to choose between two different fixed-point scalings, resulting in a compromise between the two representations. DFX has a similar implementation complexity to fixed-point systems, but offers a wider dynamic range like floating-point systems. An IIR filter implementation on a Xilinx Virtex II FPGA shows the advantages of using DFX over both fixed-point and floating-point.
411997	41199781	Multilevel logic synthesis for arithmetic functions	Arithmetic functions, a type of Boolean function, can be efficiently described using the AND and XOR operators. This is exemplified by n-bit adders. A new logic synthesis method for arithmetic functions is presented in this paper, using their natural representations in the field GF(2). This method involves algebraic factorization to reduce the number of literals. However, a direct translation of the AND/XOR representations often results in large area costs due to XOR gates. To address this issue, the paper proposes a redundancy removal process that reduces many XOR gates to single AND or OR gates without affecting the function. This process only requires simulating a small set of input patterns and has shown to produce circuits with 17% improvement in area and 50% reduction in run time compared to Berkeley SIS 1.2. The resulting circuits also have good testability and power consumption properties.
411997	411997106	Scan encoded test pattern generation for BIST	This paper describes a new scan-based BIST (built-in self-test) scheme that can achieve high fault coverage without modifying the mission logic or using complex hardware. The approach uses scan order and polarity to create a ROM that encodes a few test vectors, which are then used to generate other vectors by randomly complementing their coordinates. This method effectively tests for random pattern resistant faults, which is a common issue with traditional LFSR-based BIST. The proposed method has a lower hardware cost and more efficient algorithm compared to previous methods, and experimental results show that it can achieve high fault coverage with a smaller test set.
411997	4119978	Boolean functions classification via fixed polarity Reed-Muller forms	The paper introduces a new method for characterizing completely specified Boolean functions. The focus is on functional equivalence, where two functions are considered equivalent if they can be transformed into each other through input or output negation or permutation. The method efficiently identifies equivalence classes using the canonical Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller forms as an analysis tool. Various characteristics of Boolean functions and their variables, such as linearity and symmetry, are used to uniquely identify each equivalence class. The method is shown to successfully identify all equivalence classes for four-variable functions, with the majority having a single FPRM form as their representative. This approach has practical applications in technology mapping and designing standard cell libraries.

The input-output feedback linearization technique is utilized to stabilize the PB control systems. The paper presents two approaches to designing servo controllers for these nonlinear systems, including a two-degree of freedom controller and a model following controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through illustrative examples, where the controller is represented as a Look-Up-Table. Overall, this paper provides a practical and effective method for designing servo controllers for nonlinear systems with PB models. 
411998	41199845	Lut Controller Design With Piecewise Bilinear Systems Using Estimation Of Bounds For Approximation Errors	This article presents a proposal for stabilizing nonlinear control systems that are approximated by Piecewise Bilinear (PB) models. The PB models are fully parametric and use a Look-Up-Table (LUT) to represent the controller. The authors suggest using Input-Output (I/O) feedback linearization to stabilize PB control systems and believe that combining PB modeling with conventional feedback linearization is an effective method for analyzing and synthesizing nonlinear control systems. They also introduce a method for designing robust stabilization controllers that takes modeling error into account. The feasibility of these proposals is confirmed through examples.

The approximated model is found to be piecewise bilinear, and an optimal method for approximating nonlinear functions in this form is presented. The method of input-output feedback linearization is then applied to stabilize the control systems. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods. 
411999	41199956	Adaptation in open systems: giving interaction its rightful place	Adapting software in open systems, where autonomous and diverse participants interact, is a challenge. In these systems, each participant must adapt, but often needs to interact with others to do so. Current approaches to software adaptation, which rely on control-based abstractions, do not work well in these settings. To address this, the authors build on a recent model of interaction through social commitments. They formalize the idea of a participant's strategy for a goal, including the commitments required, and propose a framework for adaptation based on this strategy. This allows for the use of any selection criteria, such as trust. The authors provide examples from the emergency services field to illustrate their approach.
411999	41199989	A Goal-Based Organizational Perspective on Multi-agent Architectures	A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a group of independent agents that work together to achieve common goals. This paper proposes different architectural styles for MAS, based on concepts from organization theory and strategic alliances literature. These styles are modeled using the i* framework and evaluated for software quality attributes like predictability and adaptability. The paper also suggests using micro-level patterns to further describe the architecture of a MAS. An e-business example is used to illustrate the proposed styles and patterns. This research is being conducted within the Tropos methodology for agent-oriented software development.
411999	411999108	Simple and Minimum-Cost Satisfiability for Goal Models	Goal models are used in Computer Science to represent software requirements, business objectives, and design qualities. A previous study introduced a formal framework for reasoning with goal models and an algorithm for propagating values through them. This paper focuses on the qualitative framework and proposes a technique and tool for addressing two challenging problems: finding an initial assignment of labels to leaf goals that satisfies root goals while respecting constraints, and finding a minimum cost assignment of labels to leaf goals that satisfies root goals. Preliminary experimental results using a case study of the Public Transportation Service of Trentino (Italy) are also presented.
412000	41200056	The BTR-Tree: Path-Defined Version-Range Splitting in a Branched and Temporal Structure	The BTR-Tree is a new access method for branched-and-temporal databases that allows for the updating of both historic and current versions. It is based on the BT-Tree and is designed to balance space and access time tradeoffs. The BTR-Tree splits at a previous version while maintaining the posting property, reducing redundancy in the structure. It has better space efficiency and similar query efficiency compared to the BT-Tree, with no added complexity in search and posting algorithms. 
412000	4120008	Measuring and Optimizing a System for Persistent Database Sessions	The need for high availability in both data and applications is increasingly important for businesses. While database systems have support for recovery, server outages can still result in lost work for applications. This can lead to degraded application availability and require manual restarts. The Phoenix/ODBC system offers persistent database sessions that can survive a crash without the application being aware, improving availability and eliminating the need for application programming to handle crashes. It can be used with any application that accesses a database through ODBC and can be adapted for various data access protocols. An extension has also been developed to optimize response time and reduce overhead for OLTP workloads, with performance evaluations showing modest overhead.
412000	4120001	Redo Recovery after System Crashes	This paper presents a framework for understanding redo recovery after a system crash. The framework includes an installation graph, which determines the order in which operations must be installed into the stable database for successful recovery. This graph is weaker than the conflict graph used in concurrency control. The paper uses the installation graph to devise a cache management algorithm, a REDO test for selecting operations to replay during recovery, and an idempotent recovery algorithm. These algorithms are proven to be correct and can handle arbitrary logged operations. The paper also explores the impact of different logged operations on recovery and proposes a new class of logged operations that improve efficiency. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of the impact of logged operations on crash recovery and has practical implications for developing more efficient recovery methods.
412001	4120011	A concern architecture view for aspect-oriented software design	Aspect-oriented programming is gaining popularity, but there has been a lack of support for the independent description and incremental design of aspects. A conceptual framework is proposed where aspects are seen as enhancements that modify an existing design. The Concern Architecture model is used to group aspect designs and identify dependencies and potential conflicts in systems with multiple aspects. Aspects are described generically with required and provided elements, similar to formal parameters, and their binding to an existing design shows where modifications will occur. A Concern Architecture Diagram shows the overlap and partial order of aspects and concerns. An example of a UML profile and the design of a digital sound recorder illustrates the effectiveness of this approach.
412001	41200127	A calculus of superimpositions for distributed systems	A superimposition is a program module that adds functionality to an existing distributed program, even across language modularity constructs like processes or objects. There are two ways to combine superimpositions to create new ones: sequential combinations, where one is applied after the other, and merging combinations, where each is applied independently. The applicability conditions and result assertions of the component superimpositions are compared to determine if a combination is possible, and if so, the specifications and code of the resultant superimposition are obtained. By using combinations of superimpositions from libraries, less manual construction is needed and programming techniques can be standardized. Examples include dining philosopher algorithms, handling process addition and deletion, and snapshot algorithms.
412001	41200144	Aspect Validation Using Model Checking	The article discusses the model checking process for applications of aspects. It explains the various stages and proof obligations involved when combining a collection of generic aspects with a basic program. The tool, Bandera, is used to generate input for model checkers, but any similar tool can be used. The authors suggest defining new verification aspects and superimpositions to make the proof process more modular and separate it from the program and aspects. This allows for automatic generation and activation of model checking tasks when a superimposition is applied to a basic program, ensuring effective validation. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the application of this approach in monitoring and checking a bounded buffer program.
412002	41200261	MediaRank: Computational Ranking of Online News Sources.	In today's political climate, the quality of news has become a major concern for both the public and the academic community. Traditional news media is facing growing distrust, making it difficult to establish a common understanding of the truth. In response, a team has developed MediaRank, an automated system that ranks over 50,000 online news sources based on four criteria: peer reputation, reporting bias, financial pressure, and popularity. This paper presents the major contributions of MediaRank, including its open and interpretable rankings for various languages and its new methods for measuring influence and bottomline pressure. Additionally, the paper analyzes the effect of media bias on news sources and finds that despite political differences, high-ranking sources tend to favor left-wing parties in English-speaking countries.
412002	412002103	DeepWalk: online learning of social representations	DeepWalk is a new approach for learning latent representations of vertices in a network. It encodes social relations in a continuous vector space, making it useful for statistical models. The method is inspired by language modeling and unsupervised feature learning and uses local information from truncated random walks to learn latent representations. DeepWalk's performance is demonstrated on multi-label network classification tasks for social networks like BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. It outperforms other methods, especially when there is missing data, and requires less training data. The algorithm is scalable and can be easily parallelized, making it suitable for real-world applications such as network classification and anomaly detection.
412002	41200211	Don't Walk, Skip!: Online Learning of Multi-scale Network Embeddings.	WALKLETS is a new method for learning representations of vertices in a network that explicitly encode multi-scale relationships. This is achieved by sub-sampling short random walks on the vertices, generating a corpus of vertex pairs that can be used to learn a series of latent representations capturing higher order relationships. WALKLETS outperforms other methods, such as DeepWalk and LINE, on multi-label network classification tasks for social networks like BlogCatalog, DBLP, Flickr, and YouTube. It is also an online algorithm, making it scalable to large graphs with millions of vertices and edges.
412003	4120034	When the functional composition drives the user interfaces composition: process and formalization	Mashups have simplified the reuse of applications by allowing for easy combination of different applications. However, the resulting composite applications do not allow for data sharing or complex workflows. This can only be achieved by composing applications at the functional level to create new services. However, this process requires the redesign and regeneration of user interfaces in order to interact with the new service. This paper proposes a solution to this issue by implementing a process that abstracts the applications and their functional composition, allowing for the reuse of user interfaces. The process also uses a mixed-initiative framework to solve any composition conflicts, either automatically or with developer intervention.
412003	41200349	An Architecture to Support the Collection of Big Data in the Internet of Things	The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects connected to each other, collecting and sharing information. This creates a large amount of data, making the IoT an example of Big Data. This paper proposes a software architecture that supports the collection of sensor-based data in the IoT. The architecture covers the entire process, from collecting data through sensors to storing it in a cloud-based system. It can be used for research or practical purposes, such as creating innovative applications for end-users. The architecture has been tested and validated in a project called SMARTCAMPUS, where sensors are used to gather data on the SophiaTech campus for various purposes. 
412003	4120035	Cloud computing, security and data concealment	Cloud computing is a modern approach to providing software and hardware resources tailored to the needs of customers. However, it also introduces new security concerns, particularly regarding the confidentiality of data stored in cloud databases. Encrypting data alone is not enough to ensure strong protection of sensitive information. This paper examines the main security risks associated with cloud computing and specifically addresses the issue of data confidentiality in e-commerce clouds. The authors propose a data concealment component as a solution and through evaluation, demonstrate its effectiveness in safeguarding legitimate user data and defending against potential attacks.
412004	4120040	Handling Skew in Multiway Joins in Parallel Processing.	Dealing with uneven data distribution, known as skew, is a major challenge in query processing. In distributed environments like MapReduce, minimizing communication cost is a key factor. This refers to the amount of data transferred from mappers to reducers in a MapReduce job. This paper introduces a new method for handling skew in a multiway join computation using only one MapReduce round with minimal communication cost. The technique is based on the Shares algorithm and aims to optimize communication cost in distributed environments. 
412004	41200470	Optimizing joins in a map-reduce environment	Map-reduce is being utilized to handle large data operations. A new approach is being proposed to optimize joining multiple relations in the map-reduce environment. This approach involves identifying a "map-key" and assigning a "share" to each attribute, which determines how tuples are replicated. An algorithm is also presented to detect and fix issues with incorrect map-key attributes. The approach is then applied to two special cases: chain joins and star joins, resulting in less replication and improved performance. While not always superior, this method is particularly effective for analytic queries involving large fact tables and queries involving high out-degree graphs like the Web or social networks. 
412004	41200441	Answering aggregate queries in data exchange	Data exchange, also known as data translation, has been a popular topic of research in recent years. One area of focus has been on the semantics and complexity of answering first-order queries in the context of data exchange between relational schemas. This paper delves into the semantics and complexity of aggregate queries in data exchange, making significant conceptual and technical contributions. In data exchange, incomplete information is common, requiring the consideration of multiple possible worlds instead of just one database. Three sets of possible worlds have been explored for certain answers in first-order queries: the set of all solutions, the set of all universal solutions, and a set derived from the Closed World Assumption (CWA) solutions. However, none of these sets is suitable for aggregation in data exchange due to their trivial semantics. To solve this issue, the paper introduces and studies the set of endomorphic images of the canonical universal solution as a possible worlds set for aggregation in data exchange. The main technical result is the development of polynomial-time algorithms for computing the range semantics of every scalar aggregation query. Additionally, the paper shows that determining possible answer semantics for a given scalar aggregation query with the average operator is an NP-complete problem. 
412005	41200569	An Efficient Progressive Bitstream Transmission System for Hybrid Channels With Memory	This article discusses progressive transmission over a hybrid channel that introduces both bit errors and packet erasures. The authors analyze existing solutions and extend them to a channel with memory on both bit errors and packet erasures. They then propose a simple and low-complexity coding scheme that transforms the hybrid channel into a single impairment channel, making it easier to optimize. Both rate-based and distortion-based optimization problems are explored and it is shown that the proposed solution has lower complexities compared to known solutions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, and numerical results show a close match between rate-based and distortion-based optimization.
412005	412005158	A Low Complexity Progressive Bitstream Transmission System for Hybrid Channels with Correlated Loss	The proposed coding scheme is designed for the transmission of a progressive bitstream in the presence of correlated bit errors and packet erasures. It simplifies the process by transforming the hybrid channel into a single impairment channel, which can then be optimized using various techniques. The results of numerical simulations show that this scheme outperforms existing solutions in the useful operating regions of the channel. It utilizes joint source-channel coding, progressive transmission, rate allocation, and product codes.
412005	41200551	Optimal Layered Transmission Over Quasi-Static Fading Channels	The article discusses the transmission of a complex Gaussian source over a fading channel in multiple layers.

The system is implemented through kernel monitoring and has low overhead and high accuracy compared to a user-space version. Experiments were conducted using synthetic and real-world attacks, such as Apache Killer and Slowloris, on various applications, including the Apache server. The article also includes a theoretical analysis of the potential advantage for attackers who are familiar with the system, measured by a new metric. This metric can also be used to control resources consumed by demanding inputs to protected programs.
412006	41200681	Resilient and Scalable Cloned App Detection Using Forced Execution and Compression Trees	The Android market has grown in both size and diversity, offering a wide range of apps for different purposes. However, this has also led to the threat of app cloning, where adversaries copy an app and make minimal changes to redistribute it for their own gain or to distribute malicious content. Existing methods to detect clones are often ineffective and time-consuming. In this paper, the authors introduce Dexsim, a dynamic analysis system that uses a unique algorithm to accurately identify similarities in app code. The experiments showed that Dexsim is both scalable and resilient to obfuscation, detecting clones in a short amount of time with high accuracy.

While initially focusing on C and C++ code, the techniques can also be applied to binary-only environments and other languages. The system aims to quickly deploy new software releases and protect legacy software by adding security measures through instrumentation. These measures can be gradually reduced with the help of program analysis and runtime data. Artificial diversification methods are used for confinement and fault-tolerance.

412007	412007147	A cooperative immunization system for an untrusting Internet	Viruses and worms are major security threats in computer systems today, and users often rely on anti-virus programs and firewalls to protect their machines. However, these solutions can be unreliable as they rely on manual configurations and human intervention, making them vulnerable to attacks. To address this issue, a cooperative immunization system is proposed where nodes work together to defend against attacks. This system is evaluated using a virus model and simulations, which demonstrate its effectiveness against viruses and malicious participants. Overall, the cooperative immunization system offers a more robust and efficient method for protecting computer systems from attacks.
412007	4120071	Path-Based Access Control for Enterprise Networks	Enterprise networks are becoming more prevalent and complex, but the methods for managing security policies have not kept pace with advancements in networking technology. Typically, policies are defined on a per-application basis and do not interact with each other. This can lead to vulnerabilities, as there is no way for a web server to communicate its decisions to a firewall, even though they may be relevant. To address this issue, a path-based access control system for service-oriented architecture (SOA) networks is proposed, allowing services to share access-related information with each other. This system can prevent attacks where individual services make correct decisions but the overall network behavior is incorrect. It is demonstrated through graph-based policies and using the KeyNote trust management system.
412007	41200780	Behavior-Based Network Access Control: A Proof-of-Concept	Current NAC (Network Access Control) technologies have a pre-connect phase where a device's status is checked against policies before granting network access, and a post-connect phase to ensure compliance with the corresponding policies. To improve NAC, a new architecture is proposed based on behaviors instead of roles or identity, with policies automatically learned and updated based on behavior changes. Each device's behavior is modeled and used to determine acceptable behaviors in the network. A group voting process is used to make global decisions, making the architecture more resilient to attacks. This approach has a 99% detection rate of anomalous traffic with low false positives, and achieves short latencies. Proof-of-concept experiments using web traffic show the effectiveness of this enhanced NAC architecture.
412008	41200820	Whole brain diffeomorphic metric mapping via integration of sulcal and gyral curves, cortical surfaces, and images.	The paper introduces a new algorithm for registering brain images, called the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm. This algorithm is able to simultaneously map sulcal and gyral curves, cortical surfaces, and intensity images from one brain to another using diffeomorphisms. It is the first time that this type of mapping has been done in a unified manner using a shape space of intensity images and point sets. The paper describes the mathematical equation behind the algorithm and how it is implemented using computationally friendly kernels. The algorithm is then applied to align magnetic resonance brain data and is found to outperform other existing algorithms in terms of mapping accuracy and whole brain alignment.
412008	41200840	Robust diffeomorphic mapping via geodesically controlled active shapes	This paper discusses the use of diffeomorphic active shapes, specifically geodesically controlled diffeomorphic active shapes (GDAS), in the mapping of subcortical template structures. The parametrization of GDAS is done through initial momentum representation, with the dimension constrained using principal component analysis. The goal of this work is to use template surfaces to generate segmentations of the hippocampus, using three data attachment terms: surface matching, landmark matching, and inside-outside modeling. This is achieved through energy minimization and a variational solution, with a gradient descent strategy employed for numerical optimization. The robustness of this algorithm is demonstrated through comparison to an existing diffeomorphic landmark matching algorithm in a large neuroanatomical study.
412008	41200821	Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Curve Mapping.	A new matching criterion for curves has been developed and incorporated into the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) scheme, which computes the optimal transformation between two curves in Euclidean space. The curves are represented as vector-valued measures that include both location and first order geometric structure. A Hilbert space structure is then applied to these measures to create a norm for measuring the similarity between curves. This is further simplified by representing discrete sequences of points along the curve as vector-valued functionals. The matching functional for curves is derived and implemented in the LDDMM framework, with results demonstrated on 2D and 3D curves. The potential for shape classification is also explored, with experiments on 3D curves from brain cortical surfaces.
412009	41200940	Pollution-resilient peer-to-peer video streaming with Band Codes	Band Codes (BC) are a proposed solution for controlled-complexity random Network Coding (NC) in mobile applications, where energy consumption is a major concern. In this paper, the potential of BC is investigated in a peer-to-peer video streaming scenario with both malicious and honest nodes. Malicious nodes launch pollution attacks by randomly altering the content of coded packets, disrupting the video stream for honest nodes. Instead of identifying and isolating malicious nodes, this paper suggests adapting the coding scheme to introduce resilience against pollution propagation. Experimental results show that by adjusting coding parameters, the impact of a pollution attack can be reduced and the quality of the video communication can be restored. 
412009	41200955	Characterization of Band Codes for Pollution-Resilient Peer-to-Peer Video Streaming.	This article discusses the use of band codes (BC) as a solution to pollution attacks in network coding (NC)-based peer-to-peer live video streaming. These attacks occur when a malicious node injects false packets into the network, causing a cascade of erroneous packets. Traditional methods of identifying and isolating malicious nodes are not effective in NC, as the nodes exchange coded packets and it is difficult to distinguish between malicious and unwitting nodes. The authors propose using BCs, originally designed for controlling NC decoding complexity, to recombine the packets and prevent the spread of pollution. Experiments show that this approach effectively restores the quality of the video stream. 
412009	41200910	Rateless Codes and Random Walksfor P2P Resource Discovery in Grids	The paper discusses the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) resource location techniques in grid systems, focusing on scalability, reliability, efficiency, fault-tolerance, security, and robustness. It presents a query resolution problem in which one peer needs to access global information about all peers in a P2P unstructured network. The proposed solution involves using a continuous flow of control packets between nodes using the random walk principle and rateless coding. A rateless decoding mechanism is also proposed to handle asynchronous information updates. The performance of the system is evaluated both analytically and experimentally through simulations, which show that it is effective even with network and information dynamics. 
412010	41201092	Transform Coding Techniques for Lossy Hyperspectral Data Compression	Transform-based lossy compression is a promising method for reducing the size of hyperspectral data. As these data are 3-D, the correlation between dimensions must be carefully considered when designing a compression method. This paper focuses on the design of a 3-D transform and rate allocation for lossy compression of hyperspectral data. The authors first select a suitable transform for the data and then determine the optimal allocation of bits for each transformed coefficient. Experimental results show that this approach achieves better compression performance compared to traditional methods.
412010	412010111	Near-lossless distributed coding of hyperspectral images using a statistical model for probability estimation	This paper presents a new algorithm for compressing hyperspectral images with minimal loss of data. The algorithm uses distributed source coding (DSC) and employs an array of low-density parity-check codes. Unlike other DSC techniques, this algorithm determines the encoding rate for each data block using a statistical model, eliminating the need for communication between sources. Additionally, the statistical model allows for better performance by using information from previously decoded bit-planes in the same band. Experimental results on AVIRIS data show a significant improvement in performance compared to existing DSC and traditional techniques, although it does not reach the theoretical coding bounds.
412010	41201076	Image retrieval based on compressed camera sensor fingerprints	Image retrieval is the process of searching for images that meet a specific criteria from a large collection. Traditionally, this has been done through content-based retrieval, where the user looks for images with similar content to a query. However, a new approach using forensic principles has been explored in this paper. The aim is to retrieve all images in a collection that were taken by a specific device, which can be useful in detecting misuse of images. This approach does not rely on metadata, but instead uses a forensic tool called Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) to identify the unique fingerprint of a camera sensor. Recent advancements in compressing this fingerprint have allowed for large-scale image retrieval.
412011	4120114	Improved low-complexity intraband lossless compression of hyperspectral images by means of Slepian-Wolf coding	This paper introduces a new lossless compression method for remote sensing images, which is designed to work efficiently within the limited computational resources available. The method uses distributed source coding and Slepian-Wolf coding to achieve high performance while keeping the encoding complexity low. Tests on AVIRIS data demonstrate that this new approach performs similarly to CALIC and outperforms the popular JPEG 2000 method. Overall, this proposed scheme offers a promising solution for compressing multispectral and hyperspectral images in remote sensing systems.
412011	41201125	Near-lossless distributed coding of hyperspectral images using a statistical model for probability estimation	This paper presents a new algorithm for near-lossless compression of hyperspectral images using distributed source coding (DSC). The encoding process involves using syndrome coding of bit-planes and low-density parity-check codes. The algorithm is different from existing DSC techniques as it uses a statistical model to determine the encoding rate for each data block, eliminating the need for inter-source communication or a feedback channel. The statistical model also allows for improved performance by using information from previously decoded bit-planes. Experimental results with AVIRIS data show a significant performance improvement compared to existing DSC and traditional techniques, although it still falls short of theoretical coding bounds. 
412011	41201111	Joint denoising and lossless/lossy compression of SAR images	The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is not effective in compressing noisy images, but using a denoising algorithm before compression can improve its performance. However, this approach cannot be directly applied to the Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) due to its non-linear operations. To address this issue, a new algorithm based on the IWT is proposed, which can achieve similar performance to the DWT and is suitable for both denoising and compression. The algorithm is tested on SAR images and simulation results are provided.
412012	41201253	Network Communities: Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed …	This paper explores the concept of network communities as a new genre of collaboration in the CHI and CSCW communities. These are robust and persistent communities that bridge the virtual and physical worlds, and require an understanding of both technology and social dynamics. The authors examine various systems and historical examples to describe the advantages they offer to their community of users. Drawing from their own experiences, they expand on the design space by considering three dimensions: boundary negotiations between real and virtual worlds, support for social rhythms, and the emergence and growth of the community. The paper concludes with implications for designers, researchers, and community members based on their findings.
412012	41201272	Learning from seniors in network communities	In this study, researchers looked at SeniorNet, an organization that helps seniors access technology. They focused on how access to technology is influenced by social and cultural factors, specifically the role of community. Through their research, they gained a better understanding of seniors as a group and how they are supported and connected within SeniorNet communities. The researchers also found that their preconceived notions about seniors were challenged as they discovered the diverse range of individuals within the "senior" category. This has implications for addressing access issues for seniors and recognizing the benefits of technology for both seniors and those who interact with them.
412012	41201289	Augmenting shared personal calendars	Augur is a groupware calendar system designed to support personal calendaring practices, informal workplace communication, and the evolution of the calendar system within a workgroup. The success of such systems depends on multiple perspectives, which are described in this paper. Augur allows users to maintain the flexibility of personal calendars by anticipating and correcting inaccurate entries and unique event names. The system utilizes predictive user models, intelligent processing of calendar text, and shared event discovery to create visualizations that aid in interpersonal communication. It also offers visualizations for managing privacy and tracking the long-term development of the calendar system. 
412013	41201344	On the Parameterized Complexity for Token Jumping on Graphs.	The token jumping problem involves transforming one set of tokens on a graph into another set, with each transformation moving one token to a different vertex. The sets must be of equal size and all intermediate sets must also be of the same size. This problem is challenging and has been shown to be PSPACE-complete for planar graphs with maximum degree three. In this paper, the problem is further studied and it is found to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of tokens. However, an algorithm is developed that can efficiently solve the problem for general graphs when parameterized by both the number of tokens and the maximum degree. This algorithm can also find the minimum number of token movements needed to transform the initial set into the target set.
412013	41201316	Fixed-Parameter Tractability of Token Jumping on Planar Graphs.	The token jumping problem is to find a sequence of independent sets of the same size that can transform one set into another by moving one token at a time. This problem is difficult to solve, even for simple graphs. However, in this paper, the authors present a fixed-parameter algorithm that can solve this problem for planar graphs, where the parameter is the number of tokens. The algorithm can also find the shortest sequence for a successful transformation. This algorithm can also be applied to a larger class of graphs, as long as they do not contain a complete bipartite graph with a fixed integer t as a subgraph.
412013	41201358	The complexity of dominating set reconfiguration.	The paper discusses a decision problem in which we are given two dominating sets of a graph, and we need to determine whether there exists a sequence of dominating sets between them with a maximum cardinality of k, where each set can be obtained from the previous one by adding or deleting one vertex. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete, and the paper examines its complexity for different graph classes. It is shown that the problem remains PSPACE-complete for planar graphs, bounded bandwidth graphs, split graphs, and bipartite graphs, but can be solved in linear time for cographs, forests, and interval graphs. Additionally, for these tractable cases, a sequence with a bounded number of additions and deletions can be obtained. 
412014	41201426	Statistical leakage modeling for accurate yield analysis: the CDF matching method and its alternatives	This study examines the impact of statistical leakage modeling on the yield of memory designs. Different closed form models are evaluated and the CDF matching method is proposed as a comprehensive and effective approach for accurate modeling. The Schwartz-Yeh method is found to match the body and left tail of the distribution, while the Fenton-Wilkinson method focuses on the right tail. This is important for estimating yield in the presence of leaky bitlines, but the CDF matching method is still shown to be more accurate in practical applications. The estimated error in false-read probability can range from 10x to 147x and is expected to increase as technology advances.
412014	41201460	Statistical yield analysis of silicon-on-insulator embedded DRAM	This study analyzes the yield of a 65 nm SOI eDRAM design, taking into account random dopant fluctuations in the cell and micro sense amp, as well as trench capacitor variation effects. By studying different systematic corner and device type considerations, the authors were able to evaluate yield timing windows and identify suitable design guidelines. They used a fast Monte Carlo statistical analysis approach, adapted from an SRAM analysis methodology, to understand yield trends. The results show that the choice of devices and design considerations is critical for the memory operating corners and conditions, and that high vt sense amp devices are more effective in ensuring sufficient design yield windows compared to low Vt devices.
412014	41201481	SRAM methodology for yield and power efficiency: per-element selectable supplies and memory reconfiguration schemes	This article introduces a new design methodology and reconfiguration scheme for improving yield in deep submicron SRAM designs. The approach involves using a per-element selectable virtual power-supply scenario instead of a single array supply, which has been shown to be more effective in countering process variations. The element can be a bank, sub-array, or independent row/column, and its virtual supply value is determined based on fail bitmaps. This technique can be combined with traditional redundancy schemes to further enhance efficiency. The proposed algorithm for supply and redundancy assignments runs in O(nlogn) time and results in significant power savings, particularly in 65nm technology where leakage powers are dominant. This is the first known application of such a methodology to SRAM designs. 
412015	4120153	PaperPhone: understanding the use of bend gestures in mobile devices with flexible electronic paper displays	Flexible displays have the potential to mimic the interaction styles of paper documents, making them a promising technology for use in electronic devices. In this study, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of different bend gestures for performing tasks on a smartphone-inspired flexible E Ink prototype called PaperPhone. They collected 87 bend gesture pairs from ten participants and found that users preferred simpler and less physically demanding gestures that were executed along one axis. They also identified the top three most commonly used bend gesture pairs and found a strong consensus among participants for the polarity of bend gestures in actions that have a strong directional cue. This suggests that bend gestures that take directional cues into account are more natural for users to use.
412015	41201583	PaperFold: Evaluating Shape Changes for Viewport Transformations in Foldable Thin-Film Display Devices	The paper discusses the use of shape changes in a multi-segmented mobile device, called PaperFold, to trigger changes in its graphical interface. This device has foldable and reconfigurable thin-film electrophoretic display tiles, making it thin and lightweight when folded. The design of PaperFold was informed by a participatory study and resulted in 14 preferred shape changes. Another study was conducted to rank the usefulness of these shape changes in triggering common view operations in map and text editing applications. The results showed that users were able to attribute specific view operations to folding, attaching, reorienting, or detaching displays. Participants also preferred collated or full screen views when using two displays, and suggested alternative views like toolbars or a list of apps when adding a third display. Folding the segments into a three-dimensional structure was strongly associated with showing 3D views. 
412015	41201559	eyeLook: using attention to facilitate mobile media consumption	Mobile media devices can be distracting during important tasks, like navigating a busy city. To address this issue, eyeLook was created as an attention-sensitive mobile computing platform. eyeLook devices use low-cost eyeCONTACT sensors to detect when the user is looking at the display. This technology is used in two eyeLook applications, seeTV and seeTXT. seeTV is a mobile video player that pauses content when the user looks away, while seeTXT is a speed reading app that advances text only when the user is looking. This feature allows for a more courteous consumption of media in mobile contexts, allowing users to seamlessly switch between consuming media and managing daily tasks.
412016	41201685	Alternative Similarity Functions For Graph Kernels	In collaborative recommendation systems, graph kernels can be used to model the task of recommendation and rating prediction. These kernels are interpreted as inverted squared Euclidean distances in a space defined by the underlying graph. However, other similarity functions can also be used in place of this inverted squared Euclidean function. The exponential diffusion kernel, von Neumann kernel, and random forest kernel have been evaluated in this context and have been found to improve the performance of graph kernels in collaborative item recommendation and rating prediction tasks. This suggests that alternative similarity functions can enhance the effectiveness of graph kernels in these tasks.
412016	41201655	Propagation kernels: efficient graph kernels from propagated information	The article discusses a new general graph-kernel framework called "Propagation Kernels" that efficiently measures the similarity of structured data. These kernels use early-stage distributions from propagation schemes, such as random walks, to capture structural information from node labels, attributes, and edge information. This allows for the use of off-the-shelf propagation schemes and makes the computation considerably faster without sacrificing performance. In addition, if the graphs have a regular structure, the kernel computation can be scaled to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes. The effectiveness of this approach is supported by experiments on a variety of real-world graphs from different application domains. 
412016	41201657	Network growth and the spectral evolution model	The spectral evolution model is a way to understand the growth of large networks by analyzing the changes in the spectrum of their adjacency matrices. This model has been validated for various types of networks, including social, collaboration, and citation networks. Based on these findings, a new link prediction algorithm has been introduced that utilizes the spectral evolution of a network. This algorithm is more general than traditional graph kernels, as it does not rely on specific growth patterns. It has been shown to perform well for networks with irregular growth patterns.
412017	412017104	Visual Representation in the Determination of Saliency	This paper explores the impact of visual representation on the behavior of a visual salience model. Different representations have been used to create an early visual representation of image structure, and experiments show that the choice of representation significantly affects the system's behavior. The reasons for these differences are discussed and applied to vision systems in general. When design choices are arbitrary, the properties of visual representation in human early visual processing can provide insights. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of filter choice and suggests that log-Gabor filters have desirable properties.
412017	41201710	Integrating Three Mechanisms of Visual Attention for Active Visual Search.	Visual attention methods can be used to improve the performance of algorithms for robotic visual search, thereby reducing computational costs. This can be achieved by integrating three distinct mechanisms of visual attention: viewpoint selection, top-down object-based attention, and visual saliency. These methods have been previously proposed and described, but their integration within a single framework is novel and has not been extensively studied. In scenarios where there is limited information about the environment, this approach has been shown to significantly improve search performance, reducing the time and number of actions required. Extensive experiments on a mobile robot have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method.
412017	41201770	TarzaNN: a general purpose neural network simulator for visual attention modeling	In this article, the authors discuss the challenges of comparing computational models of visual attention due to differences in implementation and simulation levels. To address this issue, they have created a neural network simulator that can accommodate various models in a unified framework. This simulator allows for models to be executed in a distributed and heterogeneous environment and provides graphical tools for non-programmers to develop models. Additionally, a common model description format is available to facilitate model exchange. The paper presents the design of the simulator and showcases its versatility through results from various models.
412018	41201824	Linear hypertree for multi-dimensional image representation	The linear hypertree is a hierarchical representation of objects in d-dimensional space. It uses a hierarchical locational code to encode the rectangular coordinates of each node. Two decoding techniques are presented - one produces scalar values for the node coordinates, while the other generates them in vector form. The vectorial decoding method only applies coordinate transformations to the universe vertices, making it more efficient. Adjacency concepts in a multi-dimensional environment are defined, and a neighbor-finding algorithm is introduced that operates directly on the locational code to identify adjacent nodes. Procedures for computing the locational codes of larger and smaller neighbors are also included. Finally, an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes is described as an example of the practical use of the decoding formula and neighbor identification.
412018	41201840	Adjacency algorithms for linear octree nodes	This content introduces a formula for converting an octal locational code into rectangular coordinates X, Y, and Z for a linear octree node. The formula is simpler than previous ones proposed. Algorithms for determining the octal locational code of adjacent blocks to a given node are also introduced. These include face, edge, and corner adjacency algorithms, which use direction extensions of eastern, western, front, back, southern, and northern neighbor finding procedures. The conditions for face adjacency are formulated as digit tests on the locational codes of two nodes. These conditions are later used to determine the rightmost digit to be added or removed from the locational code to identify smaller or larger neighbors in a specific direction. The computational complexity for all presented algorithms is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the locational code.
412018	41201810	Connected component labeling with linear octree	The representation and manipulation of 3D objects are crucial in various fields like computer graphics, pattern recognition, robotics, and medical imaging. Linear octree is a hierarchical pointerless data structure used for 3D representation, which stores object elements as a list of codes. This paper focuses on a specific operation called connected component labeling and introduces a new search technique that does not require the location of a nearest common ancestor. This algorithm has a computational cost of O ( N ) and memory requirement of O ( n ) for an 8 n volume. The paper also presents a hierarchical labeling approach that eliminates the need for an equivalence table and reduces the neighbor finding technique's memory requirement from O ( n ) to O (1).
412019	41201966	Experimenting with a multi-agent e-commerce environment	Agent technology is often touted as the most natural way to automate e-commerce processes. However, despite this claim, human decision-making still plays a crucial role in the success of e-commerce systems. This has led to a lack of large-scale agent-based e-commerce applications that are actually implemented and functioning successfully. To address this, an abstract e-commerce environment is proposed where agents of different types can interact and work towards the goal of supporting e-commerce transactions. A prototype system using the JADE agent platform is described, and experiments with the implemented system are reported.
412019	41201974	Designing New Ways For Selling Airline Tickets	Recent research has focused on using multi-agent systems in e-commerce, specifically with autonomous software agents participating in auctions. To apply this concept to the airline industry, a model agent-based e-commerce system was modified to serve as an airline ticket auctioning system. This system can be integrated with a Travel Support System that utilizes a specific travel content ontology. To ensure compatibility with industry standards, an air travel ontology is needed that aligns with the Open Travel Alliance (OTA) messaging system. The goal of this paper is to explain the development of an agent-based system for selling airline tickets that follows the OTA messaging specification and adheres to IATA procedures.
412019	4120195	Developing a jade-based multi-agent e-commerce environment	Agent technology is often touted as the solution for automating e-commerce business processes and improving efficiency and profitability. However, while research on software agents has been around since the early days of the Internet, there are few successful large-scale agent-based e-commerce applications to support this claim. To address this issue, our paper discusses the use of the JADE agent platform in developing an e-commerce system. The focus of our work is on creating agents with various roles and functions commonly found in a real e-commerce environment.
412020	4120200	Geographic origin of libre software developers	This paper discusses the argument that libre (free, open source) software is a product of global development. While there is evidence that developers work in diverse teams and the community is made up of people from different countries, it is difficult to accurately determine the exact composition of the community. Past studies have relied on surveys, which may not be representative of the entire community. To address this issue, the authors propose using databases to infer the geographical location of developers. By analyzing data from SourceForge and mailing lists, they estimate the geographical origin of over one million individuals involved in libre software development. The paper concludes that this method is a good estimate of the global distribution of libre software developers.
412020	41202061	Towards predictor models for large libre software projects	Libre software offers a wide range of publicly available data sources for its development, making it possible to build predictive estimation and evolution models. However, understanding libre software development is challenging due to its unique nature compared to traditional in-house software development. The development team is a mix of hired developers and volunteers, whose level of contribution cannot be predicted in advance. In this study, the researchers analyze data from three repositories of GNOME, a large libre software project, to predict future participation and activity. The results and correlations provide initial estimations for the project's future development.
412020	4120207	Contributor Turnover in Libre Software Projects	The article discusses the issue of high staff turnover in software companies and how it is amplified in libre (free, open source) software projects due to the self-organizing nature of these projects. It raises questions about the management of human resources in these projects, as developers are not bound by contracts and there is no formal management structure. The paper proposes a quantitative methodology to study the composition and evolution of development teams in libre software projects by analyzing activity in source code management repositories. This methodology will be applied to several well-known projects and the authors will discuss the lessons learned and the validity of their proposal.
412021	41202120	Segmentation From Natural Language Expressions	This paper presents a novel approach to segmenting images based on natural language expressions, rather than traditional predefined semantic classes. The proposed model uses a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks to extract visual and linguistic information and produce pixelwise segmentation for the target object. Unlike previous approaches, this model is not limited to a fixed set of categories or rectangular regions. It has been tested on a benchmark dataset and shown to outperform other methods by a significant margin. This suggests that this model has potential for accurately segmenting images based on natural language descriptions.
412021	412021149	Cooperative Robust Estimation Using Layers of Support	The authors propose a new approach for representing images containing multiple objects or surfaces. Instead of using edges, they use a multilayer estimation framework that utilizes support maps to represent the segmentation of the image. This approach can accurately represent objects that are split into separate regions or have overlapping surfaces. The framework is based on robust estimation methods and uses a selection criteria based on the Minimum Description Length principle to determine the number of support maps needed for an image. This method has been successfully applied to various scenarios such as range image decomposition, motion field segmentation, and separation of tracked motion features. 
412021	412021119	Learning with Side Information through Modality Hallucination	This article introduces a new method for training an RGB object detection model that utilizes depth information. The proposed modality hallucination architecture involves a convolutional hallucination network that learns a new RGB image representation by mimicking mid-level features from a depth network. This improved representation is used in conjunction with the RGB network during testing to enhance detection performance. The results on the NYUDv2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, as it leads to improved performance on the RGB detection task. Overall, this method successfully transfers information from depth data to the RGB network, improving its ability to extract relevant features for object detection. 
412022	4120225	Truth Discovery in Crowdsourced Detection of Spatial Events.	The widespread use of smartphones has led to the rise of mobile crowdsourcing tasks, such as detecting spatial events as users move around in their daily lives. However, the reliability of these events can be compromised by unreliable participants and low-quality data. This presents a challenge in mobile crowdsourcing known as truth discovery, which involves identifying true events from diverse and noisy reports. This problem is unique due to uncertainties in participants' mobility and reliability. Two new unsupervised models, TSE and PTSE, are proposed to address this challenge by considering location popularity, visit indicators, and participant reliability. These models can effectively handle uncertainties and automatically discover truths without location tracking. Experimental results show that these models outperform existing approaches in mobile crowdsourcing environments.
412022	41202269	Adaptive negotiation in managing wireless sensor networks	The efficient allocation of resources in computer science is a major issue, particularly for tasks such as sensor allocation for environmental monitoring. This problem is complicated by the changing number of tasks and resources, limited resources, and competition among tasks. Many current approaches use agents to manage resources, but successful allocation for new tasks is heavily reliant on existing allocations. In this paper, a new negotiation mechanism is proposed to dynamically rearrange resource allocation for the arrival of new tasks. Experiments have shown that this approach yields better results compared to an agent-based approach without resource re-allocation through negotiation. 
412022	41202225	Semantics for Evidence-Based Argumentation	The development of computational models of argument relies heavily on the identification of consistent sets of arguments. To address this concern, a new framework has been proposed that offers a semantics for argumentation-based reasoning based on an intuitive concept of evidence. This model introduces new sets of extensions, known as evidential preferred, e-stable, and e-grounded extensions, which take into account the idea of evidence in the reasoning process. The framework also includes a new notion of attack, which determines the acceptability and admissibility of arguments. These extensions highlight the importance of evidence in argumentation and aim to improve the effectiveness of argumentation in reasoning systems.
412023	41202360	Rigorous design of robot software: A formal component-based approach	The article discusses the combination of two advanced tools, G^e^noM and BIP, for developing functional modules of robotic systems. While previous research focused on formal methods for the highest level of robot software architecture, the authors address the importance of using these methods for the functional level. They successfully apply the G^e^noM/BIP approach to a complex exploration rover, producing a fine-grained formal model and running it on the real robot to check for deadlock and safety properties. The authors have also extended this approach to include real-time capabilities, distributed processing, user-friendly language for constraints, and integration with a temporal plan execution controller. This approach can now be applied to both the lowest and highest levels of robot architecture. 
412023	41202373	Incremental Generation of Linear Invariants for Component-Based Systems	There is a need for more efficient and scalable methods for generating invariants in concurrent systems. Existing methods do not fully utilize the system's structure and algebra, leading to longer computation times and reduced scalability. A recent approach has been developed for generating Boolean invariants for systems described in the BIP component framework, which includes a rich algebra for describing component interactions. Further advancements have been made in generating linear interaction invariants, which are more precise than Boolean invariants. An incremental approach has also been proposed to reuse previously computed invariants. These techniques have been implemented in a tool called DFINDER and have shown superior performance in experiments on various models.
412023	41202327	Rigorous embedded design: challenges and perspectives.	Embedded systems are designed differently from pure software, taking into account not only functionality but also resource usage such as processing time, memory, and energy. Meeting these extra-functional specifications is crucial and requires predictability and a deep understanding of the interaction between software and the execution platform. Currently, there are no established techniques for modeling mixed hardware-software systems, but many researchers and industries are working on solutions. The Rigorous Embedded Design Red workshop at EUROSYS11 showcased new methods for this type of design, including performance analysis, correctness, code generation, and modeling. Examples from aeronautics, automotive, and robotics were discussed, highlighting the challenges and emerging approaches in this field. This paper briefly introduces these challenges and the topics covered by the workshop.
412024	41202477	An indirect robust continuous-time adaptive controller with minimal modifications	This paper investigates the effectiveness of an indirect continuous-time adaptive controller by implementing parameter projection to limit the estimated parameters within a known range. The analysis shows that the system remains globally stable in the presence of unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances, without requiring any specific signals in the closed-loop system. The controller also maintains the properties of earlier conventional adaptive controllers when the controlled plant meets certain ideal assumptions. This method does not require prior knowledge of the unmodelled dynamics for implementation.
412024	4120245	Decentralized adaptive stabilization in the presence of unknown backlash-like hysteresis	This paper addresses the challenge of designing decentralized output feedback adaptive controllers for unknown interconnected systems with hysteresis. Two new schemes are proposed using the backstepping approach, where each subsystem's general transfer function and interactions between subsystems are considered. The first scheme does not require knowledge of the bounds of unknown parameters, while the second scheme uses a projection operation when the parameters are inside known compact sets. Both schemes take into account the effects of hysteresis and interactions in devising local control laws, ensuring bounded signals in the closed-loop system. The transient system performance can be adjusted by choosing suitable design parameters. The second scheme allows for strong interactions and ensures perfect stabilization in the absence of hysteresis.
412024	412024131	Decentralized model reference adaptive control without restriction on subsystem relative degrees	The paper proposes a new method for designing decentralized controllers using the direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme with first-order local estimators. This method overcomes the limitation that the stability result can only be applied to systems with all nominal subsystems having relative degrees less than or equal to two. By employing parameter projection and static normalization, this restriction is relaxed. The proposed method does not require any prior knowledge of subsystem unmodeled dynamics or information exchange between subsystems. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven, and small tracking errors are guaranteed. This approach can be applied to a wider range of interactions and subsystem unmodeled dynamics, including those with infinite memory.
412025	41202559	Probabilistic object bases	Current object database systems are not equipped to handle uncertain attributes of objects. To address this issue, the authors propose a new algebra to handle object bases with uncertainty. They introduce concepts of consistency and provide an NP-completeness result, along with classes of probabilistic object bases for which consistency can be easily checked. The authors also discuss the importance of conjunctions and disjunctions in operations and how their probabilities depend on the probabilities of primitive events and their relationships. They demonstrate the application of their algebra in query optimization and have developed a prototype server on ObjectStore. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of different rewrite rules.
412025	412025129	Probabilistic reasoning about actions in nonmonotonic causal theories	The language PC+ is a more advanced version of the action language C+, designed for reasoning about actions with both probabilistic and nondeterministic effects. The formal semantics of PC+ is based on probabilistic transitions between sets of states. By incorporating the concepts of history and belief state, important problems in reasoning about actions can be represented in a concise manner within PC+.
412025	41202533	Efficient Evaluation of Logic Programs for Querying Data Integration Systems	Data integration systems allow access to diverse data sources through a unified view based on a global schema with integrity constraints. However, these constraints may be violated by the retrieved data, requiring methods to handle such cases. Recent approaches use nonmonotonic logic programs to model query answering in data integration, but there are no practical implementations yet due to computational complexity. This paper proposes techniques to improve the efficiency of query answering through pruning and localization of data, as well as a method to combine results using a relational database engine. Experiments show the effectiveness of these methods and suggest further exploration of this approach.

This paper presents a general algorithmic approach to retrieving meaningful geometric information from image data in any geometric domain. The approach is tailored to the specific domain and can be concretized to yield specific algorithms. As an example, the domain of plane Euclidean geometry is formally specified and concrete algorithms are presented for retrieving typical geometric objects, relations, and labels from hand-drawn diagrams in this domain. The feasibility of these algorithms is demonstrated through experiments. The paper also showcases how this approach can automatically discover implied geometric knowledge from images, illustrated through an example of generating nontrivial geometric theorems from retrieved information.
412026	41202615	Towards a geometric-object-oriented language	This paper introduces a new language for performing symbolic geometric computation, reasoning, and visualization. The language allows for the creation of geometric objects using parametric data, as well as modifying and performing basic operations on these objects. Special attention is given to handling degeneracy and uncertainty through conditions and assumptions. Geometric statements can be declared by defining relationships between different objects. The proposed system, which is based on this language, enables users to rigorously perform geometric computations, prove theorems, and generate diagrams and interactive documents. The paper outlines the design of the language, its capabilities and features, as well as its main components. It also includes specifications for some of its functions, reports on experiments with a preliminary implementation, and discusses potential difficulties and research questions. 
412026	41202646	Formalization and Specification of Geometric Knowledge Objects.	This paper introduces a method for identifying, formalizing, organizing, and specifying geometric knowledge objects for the purpose of managing and representing knowledge. The authors use a classification system to categorize geometric knowledge found in literature, and then use first-order logic to formalize statements. The resulting knowledge objects are stored in a retrievable and expandable data structure, and organized according to their hierarchical relationships. Several examples are provided to demonstrate this approach, which has been successfully used for automated geometric reasoning, creating knowledge bases, and generating electronic documents. This work was published by Springer Basel in 2013.
412027	41202735	Transparent multi-core speculative parallelization of DES models with event and cross-state dependencies	This article discusses the transparent parallelization of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) models on multi-core machines using speculative schemes. The proposed approach allows simulation objects to access and modify the state of any other object, creating what is called cross-state dependency. This differs from traditional PDES platforms where access is limited to the object being processed. To ensure consistency in parallel execution, an advanced memory management architecture and synchronization mechanisms are introduced. This approach has been integrated with the ROOT-Sim platform, but can also be applied more broadly. It aims to improve performance and efficiency while maintaining transparency in handling cross-state and traditional event-based dependencies.
412027	41202717	Transparent Speculative Parallelization of Discrete Event Simulation Applications Using Global Variables.	Parallelizing discrete event simulation (DES) applications has long been a method for improving their speed and making large and complex simulation models manageable. This is typically done through parallel DES (PDES) techniques, which involve breaking the simulation model into separate objects that execute concurrently and rely on event-exchange or scheduling to handle dependencies. However, this approach restricts the use of shared information, such as global variables, within the application code. To address this limitation, a new method for managing global variables in parallel DES code written in ANSI-C is proposed. This method is based on multi-versioning and a rollback/recovery scheme to ensure consistency and efficiency. The approach is fully transparent and has been tested on various case study applications with positive results.
412027	4120275	Towards a fully non-blocking share-everything PDES platform.	Shared-memory multi-core platforms have led to changes in Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES), specifically in the concept of share-everything PDES. This paradigm allows for full sharing of event processing across threads, eliminating the need for temporary binding of simulation objects to worker threads. While there has been focus on designing concurrent shared pools, there is still a lack of synchronization support for scenarios where multiple threads pick events for the same simulation object. This can lead to mutual thread blocks. To address this issue, a share-everything speculative PDES engine has been designed, with a focus on non-blocking operations and innovative event-dispatching and management of the shared event pool. This vertical view of non-blocking operations is a key aspect of the engine's design.
412028	41202813	CrowdScreen: algorithms for filtering data with humans	The problem of filtering a large set of data items based on human-verifiable properties is common in crowdsourcing applications, but has not been formally optimized. Most solutions use heuristics instead of formal optimization. This study presents different versions of the problem and develops deterministic and probabilistic algorithms to optimize the expected cost and expected error. These algorithms outperform other strategies in experimental testing and can be applied in various crowdsourcing scenarios. They can also be integrated into query processors that use human computation.
412028	4120283	Finish Them!: Pricing Algorithms for Human Computation.	This article discusses the importance of setting and varying the price of human computation tasks in order to meet time and cost constraints. It points out that often the price is set beforehand and not adjusted, leading to either unnecessary high costs or longer processing time. The authors propose algorithms based on a pricing model from previous research to optimally set and change the price over time. These algorithms use techniques from decision theory and have been shown to reduce costs by up to 30% compared to previous methods. Additionally, the authors have developed methods to speed up the computation process, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments to prices. 
412028	41202814	Efficient parsing-based search over structured data	Parsing-based search is a method of analyzing keyword search queries using grammars. This approach allows for a richer and more customizable understanding of search queries compared to the traditional "bag-of-words" approach. While a formalism for parsing-based semantics has been proposed, the problem of designing efficient algorithms to support this approach has not been extensively studied. In this paper, the authors present a suite of efficient algorithms and indexes to address this problem. These algorithms are designed to work with various grammars commonly used in practice and can handle different types of database matching and scoring functions. The authors also analyze the time complexity of their algorithms and provide evidence of their scalability through an empirical evaluation using real-world data. 
412029	41202958	Rank-Aware Query Processing and Optimization	This dissertation proposes a framework for supporting ranking in relational database systems through the integration of ranking algorithms and operators in query processing and optimization. Two rank-join algorithms are introduced, one for joining multiple ranked inputs on key attributes and another for general join conditions. These algorithms use individual orders of input relations and result in ordered join results based on a user-specified scoring function. Practical issues and optimization heuristics are addressed to integrate the new operators in query processors. A rank-aware query optimization framework is also introduced, based on a dynamic programming algorithm, to generate optimal rank-aware query plans. A probabilistic model is introduced for estimating the input cardinality and cost of a rank-join operator. Experimental evaluation shows the superior performance of the proposed techniques in joining ranked inputs and the accuracy of the estimation model.
412029	41202956	Adaptive rank-aware query optimization in relational databases	Rank-aware query processing is becoming increasingly important in modern applications. Efficient and adaptive evaluation of top-k queries is crucial for these applications, and a new framework has been introduced to fully integrate rank-join operators into relational query engines. This framework extends the System R dynamic programming algorithm and uses a probabilistic model for estimating the input cardinality of these operators. Additionally, several adaptive execution strategies have been introduced to respond to estimation errors and changes in the computing environment. An extensive experimental study shows the effectiveness of this framework and the significant speedup achieved through adaptive execution of ranking plans.
412029	41202947	Uncertainty in rank join	The query processing engine of a search computing system uses operators to retrieve, filter, join, and aggregate results from Web services. The main goal is to provide relevant answers to user queries from multiple domains. Users typically expect a ranked list of relevant answers, rather than the full answer set. This makes ranking query results in the presence of uncertainty a key challenge in search computing environments. The rank-join operator is a basic relational operator that reports the top-k join results quickly, without having to fully process and sort all the data. It is a crucial component for executing multi-domain queries, also known as liquid queries. This chapter discusses how data uncertainty affects the semantics and implementation of rank-join operators, and reviews recent techniques for addressing these challenges.
412030	41203017	A declarative approach to distributed computing: Specification, execution and analysis.	The use of logic programming for distributed algorithms is gaining interest for various network applications. These applications involve multiple devices sharing data and computation, with the ability to exchange information and collaborate. A declarative approach is proposed in this paper, where algorithms and communication models can be specified as action theories and executed as collections of distributed state machines. Devices are represented as automata that can communicate through messages. The approach is also analyzed using existing theories on causal theories and Answer Set Programming. The paper also presents results on the application of this approach to different types of network protocols.
412030	4120304	Declarative distributed computing	In this paper, a language for writing distributed applications is introduced, along with an operational semantics for a single computational node based on Datalog. The paper also presents a framework that can capture the semantics of a network of computational nodes working together. This framework can express different communication models and can be used to check various properties of the distributed computation. The framework is developed using Answer Set Programs.
412030	41203032	Distributed state machines: a declarative framework for the management of distributed systems	This paper discusses the implementation of a declarative framework for creating distributed management applications. The framework uses declarative networking, which is an asynchronous computational model that utilizes recursive SQL. This approach has been used successfully for various networking protocols, including preference-based routing and standard routing protocols. The use of SQL allows for analysis capabilities that can help prevent errors in implementation and logic. By utilizing this framework, developers can easily and efficiently create distributed management applications with a reduced risk of errors.
412031	41203121	Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning: A Generalisation of Progol	Progo15 and the Bottom Generalisation method are widely used in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). However, they are limited in their ability to find hypotheses within the scope of Plotkin's relative subsumption. This paper uncovers a new limitation of Progo15 and proposes a new approach called Hybrid Abductive Inductive Learning that combines ILP and Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). This approach, implemented through the HAIL proof procedure, not only overcomes the limitation of Progo15 but also allows for the generation of multiple clauses from a single example and the derivation of hypotheses outside of Plotkin's relative subsumption. A new semantics, called Kernel Generalisation, is also introduced to encompass the hypotheses produced by HAIL.
412031	41203127	Induction on Failure: Learning Connected Horn Theories	Inverse Entailment (IE) is a popular learning technique that has been used to develop various learning systems. These systems, such as Progol, generate hypotheses in the form of single or multiple clauses. However, they all share a limited search space in which each clause must explain a given example or an abductive explanation for it. This paper introduces a new IE approach, called Induction on Failure (IoF), which expands the search space to include Connected Theories. A proof procedure for IoF is proposed and a prototype implementation is described. Additionally, a new semantics called Connected Theory Generalisation is introduced, which extends the existing Kernel Set Subsumption and allows for hypotheses to be generated using the IoF approach.
412031	4120311	Inductive Learning of Answer Set Programs.	The focus of existing research on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has been on learning definite programs or normal logic programs. However, in this paper, the authors propose a new approach that expands the computational boundaries to include Answer Set Programs. This new paradigm integrates the existing concepts of brave and cautious semantics to create a unified learning framework that produces Answer Set Programs as inductive solutions. The paper presents an algorithm that is sound and complete for this new type of inductive solutions, and introduces a prototype implementation called ILASP (Inductive Learning of Answer Set Programs). The effectiveness of ILASP is demonstrated through its application in planning, specifically in learning an agent's knowledge about its environment and creating plans for the agent to navigate through the environment.
412032	412032213	Temporal quality assessment for mobile videos	The paper discusses the challenges of assessing video quality in mobile devices, such as limited computation power and wireless network issues. The authors propose a Temporal Variation Metric (TVM) to measure the temporal information of videos, which shows a high correlation with optical flow. They then use this metric to create a reduced-reference temporal quality assessment metric, Temporal Variation Index (TVI), which can predict users' Quality of Experience (QoE) and estimate network conditions. Subjective assessments show a 92.5% correlation between TVI and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) ratings, and video streaming experiments demonstrate an accuracy of 95% in predicting packet loss and delay.
412032	41203243	Evaluating perceptual video quality for mobile clients in 802.11n WLAN	This paper explores the performance of HD video streaming in 802.11n WLANs when users are moving. Experiments were conducted in a low electromagnetic interference outdoor wireless testbed. The study found that both user speed and distance from the access point (AP) affect video quality. A non-linear regression model was built using subjective scores and objective video quality metrics, which showed a 69% correlation with video quality. The model also found that distance has a greater impact on video quality than speed. However, physical factors alone cannot accurately predict video quality. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both speed and distance when optimizing video streaming in WLANs.
412032	41203296	Toward Deployable Methods for Assessment of Quality for Scalable IPTV Services.	Scalable video coding (H.264 SVC) allows video service providers to adapt a video's bitstream to suit different network conditions and device characteristics. This can be achieved by reducing the video's bitrate through modifications in frame rate, resolution, and quantization levels. This paper evaluates the effects of such scalability using full-reference and no-reference video quality metrics, and discusses how these results can be used to enable or supplement existing quality assessment metrics. The use of a reduced reference metric called delta-blocking is proposed to detect visual damage in frames and a windowing algorithm is suggested to combat frame loss. The study also aims to determine if the conclusions drawn from previous works on test video content hold true for real-world broadcast content.
412033	41203327	MST construction in O(log log n) communication rounds	The article discusses a basic model for overlay networks in which all processes are connected to each other and messages contain a maximum of O(log n) bits. A distributed algorithm is presented for this model, which can construct a minimum-weight spanning tree in O(log log n) communication rounds. This is the first algorithm to achieve a time complexity of less than ω(log n) with small message sizes.
412033	41203355	Distributed MST for constant diameter graphs	This paper discusses the problem of creating a minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) in a distributed manner for graphs with a constant diameter, where each message has a limited size of B bits. It is proven that the time needed to compute an MST for graphs of diameter 4 or 3 can be as high as &OHgr;(3√n/B) and &OHgr;(4√n/2√B), respectively, even with randomized algorithms. However, it is also shown that for graphs with diameter 2 and B = O(log n), an MST can be computed deterministically in O(log n) time. These results add to a previously known lower bound of &OHgr;(2√n/B) for graphs with diameter &OHgr;(log n). 
412033	41203381	Order optimal information spreading using algebraic gossip	This paper focuses on the study of gossip-based information spreading with limited message sizes. The authors use algebraic gossip to distribute k different messages to all n nodes in a network. They present a new upper bound for uniform algebraic gossip in arbitrary networks, which is O((k + log n + D)Δ) rounds with high probability, where D and Δ represent the diameter and maximum degree of the network. They also propose a non-uniform gossip protocol, TAG, which eliminates the factor of Δ and has a stopping time of O(k+ log n + d(S) + t(S)), where t(S) is the stopping time of the spanning tree protocol and d(S) is the diameter of the spanning tree. The authors provide two cases where this bound leads to an order optimal protocol. The approach used in their proofs relies on queuing theory, which can be useful in future gossip analysis.
412034	41203442	An interoperable delivery framework for scalable media resources	This article discusses a framework for delivering scalable media resources, such as videos, in a standardized format. The framework supports both video on demand and multicast streaming and uses MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation for efficient and interoperable content adaptation. The server and clients of the framework use the MPEG Extensible Middleware and MPEG Query Format for querying available resources. The framework has been integrated into the VLC media player and the architecture for both video on demand and multicast is described. A comparison of the performance of the framework's generic MPEG-21 metadata-based approach to a specific scalable video coding approach is also provided.
412034	41203415	Bitstream syntax description: a tool for multimedia resource adaptation within MPEG-21.	This paper outlines a method for adapting different multimedia resources using a single media processor. The method involves transforming an XML description of the media resource's bitstream syntax to generate an adapted version of the bitstream. The paper also introduces two technologies, BSDL22 and gBS Schema, which aid in parsing the bitstream, structuring and marking the XML description, and generating the adapted bitstream. These technologies can be used separately, but a combined approach has been developed to optimize their effectiveness. The focus of the paper is on the gBS Schema and the harmonized approach using both BSDL and gBS Schema.
412034	41203434	Transport Mechanisms For Metadata-Driven Distributed Multimedia Adaptation'	The information revolution has led to an enormous increase in multimedia content available to users through various devices and networks. To handle the diverse types of content, MPEG-21 DIA has introduced interoperable tools for coding format independent adaptation. This includes adaptation on both the server and within the network to efficiently deliver content to devices with different capabilities and over various networks. This paper presents three transport mechanisms for delivering MPEG-21-based metadata for genetic adaptation within the network, as well as a payload format for this metadata. Measurements show that this approach has bandwidth benefits compared to server-centric adaptation in a multicast scenario. Additionally, using different encoding formats for the metadata reduces overhead.
412035	4120350	Online learning of correspondences between images.	The proposed method is used for finding corresponding points between images in a sequence. This is done by projecting 3D points onto two images and then determining the corresponding point in the other image. The projections and surface shape are unknown, making it difficult to find correspondences without access to the 3D scene. However, the proposed method uses an iterative approach with a chi-square divergence optimization to accurately and quickly determine the mappings between points. This algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of convergence and accuracy in various experiments and can run in real time.
412035	41203519	Real-time visual recognition of objects and scenes using P-channel matching	The paper proposes a new method for real-time view-based object recognition and scene registration. This is important for tasks like robotics, retrieval, and surveillance. The proposed method uses P-channels, a type of information representation that combines features of histograms and local linear models. This approach is inspired by biological systems and is robust against common distortions like clutter and occlusion. The algorithm extracts intensity invariant image features, encodes them into P-channels, and compares them to prototype P-channels in a database. The method is evaluated on the COIL database and achieves excellent results. Results from scene registration using a fish-eye camera are also presented. 
412035	41203521	Scale Coding Bag-of-Words for Action Recognition.	Recognizing human actions in still images is a difficult task in computer vision, as there are many variables such as scale, illumination, and pose variation to consider. Most current methods use the bag-of-words paradigm, which creates a scale invariant image representation by binning features from multiple scales into a single histogram. However, this approach ignores important multi-scale information. This paper proposes three alternative methods for scale coding in action recognition, which explicitly encode multi-scale information in separate histograms for small, medium, and large scales. These approaches outperform the traditional scale invariant technique and show promising results compared to more complex methods. The experiments were conducted on the Willow dataset, which contains seven action categories.
412036	4120367	The weakest failure detector for solving consensus	In the paper, "Consensus in Asynchronous Distributed Systems with Crash Failures," the authors discuss the minimum amount of information needed to solve the Consensus problem in asynchronous distributed systems with crash failures. They prove that a failure detector, which provides very little information about crashed processes, is sufficient to solve the problem. This is known as the {0 failure detector. The authors also demonstrate that any failure detector must provide at least as much information as {0 in order to solve Consensus. Therefore, {0 is considered the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct processes.
412036	41203658	Unreliable failure detectors for reliable distributed systems	Unreliable failure detectors are introduced as a way to solve Consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. These detectors are characterized by two properties - completeness and accuracy. The study shows that Consensus can still be achieved even with unreliable failure detectors that make infinite mistakes. It is also determined which detectors can solve Consensus despite any number of crashes, and which ones require a majority of correct processes. It is proven that Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are reducible to each other in these systems, and a specific failure detector is found to be the weakest for solving Consensus.
412036	41203638	On the quality of service of failure detectors	This study focuses on the quality of service (QoS) of failure detectors. QoS is measured by the speed of detecting failures and the accuracy in avoiding false detections. The authors propose a set of QoS metrics for failure detectors in systems with probabilistic behaviors. They also introduce a new algorithm that is optimal in terms of these metrics. The parameters of the algorithm can be computed to meet specific QoS requirements, even when the probabilistic behavior of the system is unknown. Simulation results show that the new algorithm outperforms a commonly used one. The authors suggest making the failure detector adaptive to changes in network behavior.
412037	4120370	Efficiently refactoring java applications to use generic libraries	Java 1.5 generics allow for the creation of reusable container classes that ensure safe usage through type enforcement by the compiler. This eliminates the need for potentially unsafe down-casts when retrieving elements from containers. A refactoring technique has been developed to replace raw references to generic library classes with parameterized references. The refactoring uses type constraints to infer type parameters and removes redundant casts. The refactoring has been implemented in the Eclipse development environment and has been evaluated by refactoring Java programs that use the standard collections framework to use Java 1.5 generics. On average, 48.6% of casts are removed and 91.2% of compiler warnings related to raw types are eliminated. This approach is more scalable, can accommodate user-defined subtypes, and is integrated in a popular IDE, setting it apart from previous techniques.
412037	4120377	Program analysis for mobile: how and why to run WALA on your phone.	With the widespread use of mobile devices, security has become a major concern. This includes protecting the devices themselves as well as the data they contain from attacks and theft. One way to ensure security is through static analysis of the device's software. Various tools have been developed to analyze individual apps for potential vulnerabilities, but now there are also tools that can detect threats from multiple apps on a single device. This type of analysis is best performed on app stores, but it can be challenging in the Android environment where apps can be installed from various sources. Therefore, there is a growing interest in running analysis directly on the device, but this approach also has its own challenges, including the need to build and deploy analysis tools on mobile devices and concerns about resource usage and battery drain. The authors present their work on running program analysis on mobile devices, specifically using the WALA framework on Android. They demonstrate that it is feasible to build and deploy WALA for Android and that its performance is reasonable. 
412037	41203711	Finding concurrency-related bugs using random isolation	This paper discusses the automatic verification of safety properties in concurrent programs, specifically focusing on detecting multi-location data races in concurrent Java programs. The main challenge addressed is how to generate a program model that accurately represents the synchronization operations of the concrete program, especially when dynamic memory allocation is involved. The authors propose the use of the "random-isolation" abstraction, where two abstract objects are associated with each program allocation site, allowing for strong updates and enabling the detection of strong judgments regarding lock states. This approach has been implemented in a tool called Empire, which verifies atomic-set serializability in concurrent Java programs. Overall, the random-isolation abstraction allows for more accurate tracking of lock states in concurrent programs.
412038	412038169	Conditional Density Estimation with Dimensionality Reduction via Squared-Loss Conditional Entropy Minimization	Regression is a commonly used method for estimating the conditional mean of output based on input. However, it lacks effectiveness when dealing with complex data that has multiple modes, varying levels of variability, and asymmetry. In these cases, it is better to estimate the conditional density itself, but this is difficult in high-dimensional spaces. One approach to address this is to first use dimensionality reduction (DR) and then perform conditional density estimation (CDE). However, this two-step process can lead to significant errors. To address this issue, the authors propose a new method that simultaneously performs DR and CDE by formulating DR as a problem of minimizing a squared-loss version of conditional entropy. This eliminates the need for an additional CDE step and has been tested on various data sets with promising results.
412038	412038199	Direct conditional probability density estimation with sparse feature selection	Regression is a common statistical analysis method used to estimate the relationship between input and output variables. However, when the conditional probability density is complex, traditional regression methods may not provide sufficient information. To address this issue, researchers have developed estimators of conditional densities, such as the least-squares conditional density estimation (LS-CDE). However, LS-CDE can still be inaccurate if the input contains irrelevant features. To improve upon this, a new approach called sparse additive CDE (SA-CDE) has been proposed. This method applies LS-CDE to each input feature and uses a group-sparse regularizer to automatically select relevant features. An efficient optimization method has also been developed for SA-CDE, making it applicable to large and high-dimensional datasets. Experiments with different datasets have shown the effectiveness of SA-CDE in noisy conditional density estimation problems.
412038	412038180	Direct Density Ratio Estimation with Dimensionality Reduction	Recently, there has been a focus on finding ways to directly estimate the ratio of two probability density functions without the need for density estimation. This is useful for tasks such as non-stationarity adaptation, outlier detection, and feature selection. However, even the best methods for density ratio estimation struggle in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, a new method is proposed that incorporates dimensionality reduction into the density ratio estimation process. By identifying a low-dimensional subspace where the two densities differ significantly, the ratio is estimated only within this subspace. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of this approach.
412039	41203952	Bayesian statistical model checking with application to Stateflow/Simulink verification	The article discusses the problem of model checking stochastic systems, which involves determining if a system satisfies a temporal property with a certain probability threshold. The authors propose a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on Bayesian statistics, which is applicable to a class of hybrid systems with stochastic transitions. This approach combines randomized sampling of system traces with hypothesis testing or estimation to efficiently solve the verification problem. While not guaranteed to be correct, the Bayesian SMC approach can make the probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily small. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a fuel control system model and suggest its potential for other stochastic models. 
412039	41203957	Safe Reinforcement Learning via Formal Methods: Toward Safe Control Through Proof and Learning.	Formal verification is a method of ensuring the safe operation of systems, but it relies on the system matching the verified model. However, models are often incomplete, especially in Cyber-Physical Systems where physical models are costly and difficult to verify. On the other hand, reinforcement learning-based controllers are flexible but do not guarantee safety. This paper proposes a way to combine formal verification with verified runtime monitoring to ensure safe learning. The key is to limit exploration to verified control choices and adjust the control strategy when a model violation is detected. This approach maintains safety guarantees while also retaining the performance benefits of reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using a simple model of adaptive cruise control for autonomous cars.
412039	4120390	Forward invariant cuts to simplify proofs of safety	Deductive techniques, specifically theorem provers, are useful for verifying the safety of hybrid systems. However, current theorem provers require manual intervention for complex systems and there is often a gap between the assistance they require and what a system designer can provide. This paper introduces an extension to KeYmaera, a deductive verification tool, that allows for local reasoning using system designer intuition about performance in specific modes. This approach utilizes forward invariants, discovered using numerical techniques, to prove safety. A new inference rule, the forward invariant cut rule, is introduced and a methodology for discovering useful forward invariants is presented. This new approach is demonstrated to be effective in completing verification tasks that are beyond the capabilities of existing automatic verification approaches, including an example involving an automotive powertrain control system.
412040	412040101	Symmetric public-key encryption	Public-key encryption is typically seen as assymetric, as it only allows for messages to be encrypted using a user's public key. However, the use of interactive protocols can allow for a symmetric use of public keys. This means that the same public key can be used for both encrypting messages sent to a user and messages sent by the user to others, without compromising the key. These protocols also allow for probabilistic encryption, which is when the same message can have different encrypted versions. The proposed public-key cryptosystem based on these protocols only requires one key owned by a cryptographic server. Additionally, the protocols allow for authentication of both the sender and receiver of a probabilistically encrypted message, and are secure against chosen-message and chosen-ciphertext attacks. 
412040	41204030	Efficient Dynamic-Resharing "Verifiable Secret Sharing" Against Mobile Adversary	The article introduces a new and efficient version of Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) that addresses the threat of a mobile adversary controlling a limited number of trustees at any given time. VSS allows for the secure sharing of a secret among a group of trustees, ensuring validity and preventing premature opening by a small group. This type of sharing has gained attention in contexts such as escrowed cryptography. The dynamic-sharing VSS presented in the article can handle attacks from a mobile adversary by using simple direct methods and public-key functions. The authors also present constant round protocols and reduce VSS to simpler forms.
412040	41204053	A Generalization of a Lower Bound Technique due to Fredman and Saks	In a 1989 paper, Fredman and Saks proved lower bounds for data-structure problems in the cell probe model. They established lower bounds on operation cost for the union-find and prefix sum problems. The paper aims to turn their proof technique into a general tool for different problems and computational models. This is achieved by defining Output Variability, which measures the variation in program results for a given resource bound, and Problem Variability, which characterizes the difficulty of a problem. By comparing these two quantities, the paper's main theorem shows how to infer lower bounds for solving a problem on a given model. The paper also demonstrates how this technique can be applied to the results of Fredman and Saks, reproducing their lower bounds and extending them slightly. The main contribution of the paper is the presentation of this generalized technique.
412041	41204137	Dynamic dictionary matching	The dynamic dictionary matching problem involves finding patterns in a changing dictionary of strings. The goal is to efficiently search a given text for occurrences of any pattern in the dictionary. An algorithm is presented that can insert or delete patterns from the dictionary with a time complexity of O(m log |D"i|), where m is the length of the pattern and |D"i| is the size of the dictionary after the operation. Searching for patterns in the text has a time complexity of O((n + tocc) log |D"i|), where n is the length of the text and tocc is the total number of occurrences of patterns in the text. 
412041	41204142	On-line construction of two-dimensional suffix trees	An on-line data structure is one that is continuously updated to correspond to the input it has received so far. This is seen in the example of a suffix tree, where the algorithm builds the tree as it reads characters from a string. The authors introduce a new technique called implicit updates, which allows for the on-line construction of the Lsuffix tree for an n x n matrix and for simple algorithms for LZ1-type on-line lossless image compression. These algorithms show significant improvement over existing techniques and may lead to faster implementations. This is the first effective technique for on-line construction of two-dimensional suffix trees. 
412041	41204126	On-Line Construction of Two-Dimensional Suffix Trees in O(n2 log n) Time	The two-dimensional suffix tree is a data structure used to represent all square submatrices of a given n × n square matrix. It can be built in optimal time for any alphabet size for the off-line case, where the matrix is given in advance. For the on-line case, where the matrix is given one element at a time, an algorithm called GG was previously developed by Giancarlo and Guaiana, but it had a time complexity of O(n2log2n). This paper presents an improvement on the GG algorithm, reducing its time complexity to O(n2) and simplifying its structure. This improvement is achieved by reorganizing Weiner's algorithm for constructing standard suffix trees. 
412042	41204245	Reasoning About Constraint Models	A framework has been proposed to reason about characteristics of models expressed in languages such as AMPL, OPL, Zinc or Essence. However, the framework has shown that certain reasoning problems, like detecting symmetries, redundant constraints, or dualities between models, cannot be solved even for simple problem instances. To assist human modellers, automation of these reasoning tasks would be helpful. Two case-studies have been described to explore the possibility of automating these tasks. The first uses the ACL2 inductive prover to prove the existence of a symmetry in a model, while the second identifies a tractable subset of MiniZinc and uses a decision procedure to prove a parameterized constraint in a model. 
412042	41204258	Constraint Acquisition as Semi-Automatic Modeling 	Constraint programming is a popular technology used in solving complex problems in industries. However, it requires significant expertise in constraint reasoning.

412043	4120433	An empirical simulation-based study of real-time speech translation for multilingual global project teams	Real-time speech translation technology is currently available, but its impact on communication in global software projects is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the use of combining speech recognition and machine translation to overcome language barriers in remote software requirement negotiations. The study used Google Web Speech API and Google Translate service, two groups of four subjects speaking Italian and Brazilian Portuguese, and a test set of 60 technical and non-technical utterances. The results showed that while there was satisfactory accuracy in terms of speech recognition, it was affected by differences in speakers and utterances. It was also found that accurate transcripts were crucial for successful translations, highlighting the importance of speech recognition in speech translation technology. Overall, the study suggests that speech translation technology can be used to facilitate communication among globally distributed team members in their native languages.
412043	4120436	A Controlled Experiment on the Effects of Machine Translation in Multilingual Requirements Meetings	The article discusses the challenges of language barriers in global software projects and how machine translation technology can help in remote requirements meetings. A controlled experiment was designed to investigate the effects of using machine translation services in these meetings. Participants, who were native Italian or Portuguese speakers, were asked to use a communication tool and prioritize and estimate requirements. Initial results show that real-time machine translation was well-received and did not disrupt the flow of conversation. However, the full impact of this technology is yet to be seen in situations where language barriers are more significant.
412043	41204320	Assessing the impact of real-time machine translation on multilingual meetings in global software projects	Language differences in global software development can hinder communication, especially in countries with a lack of English speaking professionals. To address this issue, machine translation technology has steadily evolved in the past decade, making it a promising solution for cross-language chat services in international software projects. However, the impact of real-time machine translation on communication is not fully understood. To address this gap, a set of empirical studies was conducted to assess the effectiveness of real-time machine translation in multilingual requirements meetings. The results show that while the technology is not 100% accurate, it does not disrupt the conversation flow and is generally accepted by participants. However, in situations with more critical language barriers, the effects may be stronger. These findings provide valuable insights for global software engineering practitioners considering the use of English as a lingua franca in multilingual group communication, such as computer-mediated requirements meetings.
412044	41204413	Building a Knowledge Experience Base for Facilitating Innovation.	In this paper, the authors introduce a framework designed to facilitate knowledge transfer within and outside of an organization for the purpose of innovation. The framework includes a Knowledge Experience Base (KEB) that gathers Knowledge Experience Packages (KEP) to help formalize and package knowledge and experience from innovation stakeholders. This encourages the gradual explanation of implicit knowledge from those who possess it, making the transfer process easier and reducing costs and risks. By using this framework, organizations can improve their ability to transfer knowledge and drive innovation. 
412044	41204430	Empirical Validation Of Knowledge Packages As Facilitators For Knowledge Transfer	The transfer of research findings into production systems requires explicit and understandable knowledge for stakeholders. This is a challenging task, as many researchers have explored alternative methods to traditional approaches like books and papers for knowledge acquisition. The concept of a Knowledge Experience Package (KEP) is proposed as a structured alternative. The KEP contains both the conceptual models and documentation of the research results, as well as the experience gained in acquiring them in business processes. The structure of the KEP allows for easier acquisition of necessary knowledge chunks, and the experience provides insight into potential scenarios. A comparison experiment showed that KEPs are more effective for knowledge transfer than traditional methods.
412044	41204421	Empirical Experimentation for Validating the Usability of Knowledge Packages in Transferring Innovations	The transfer of research results to technological innovation and their implementation in a company is crucial for success. A key factor in this process is the transfer of knowledge, which must be understandable and explicit for all stakeholders. Many studies have explored alternative methods for knowledge acquisition, such as books and papers. In this study, the Knowledge Package (KP) structure was proposed as a more efficient alternative. An experiment was conducted to compare the usability, efficiency, and comprehensibility of KPs with conventional knowledge sources. The results showed that KPs are more efficient in transferring knowledge. The experiment was conducted following guidelines for replication, allowing other researchers to confirm or refute the results. This ensures the validity of the findings.
412045	41204546	First GrC model - Neighborhood Systems the most general rough set models	The Neighborhood System (NS) is a formal model that revisits the concept of infinitesimals, which played a crucial role in the development of calculus, topology, and non-standard analysis. It is shown in this paper that Ziarko's variable precision model can be expressed using NS. Additionally, NS is the most comprehensive rough set model, as it includes topology, binary relation, and covering as special cases. A new operation called "and" is introduced, which generates a base of a topology, referred to as a knowledge base. The approximations based on this knowledge base can be interpreted as learning, which distinguishes it from traditional rough set approximations. 
412045	41204567	Granular Computing and Modeling the Human Thoughts in Web Documents	The concept of human thoughts in a document set can be represented by a polyhedron, with a point representing a single thought, a simplex representing a concept, and a connected component representing a complete concept. The simplest unit is the simplex, which is made up of high frequency and closely related keywords. The structure of these keywords forms a "informal" formal language that describes the human thoughts in the document set. The model theory of this language is used to create a desired model of the human thoughts in the document set.
412045	41204522	Attribute (Feature) Completion - The Theory of Attributes from Data Mining Prospect	Choosing the right attributes is crucial in data mining. To do this, the paper creates a list of all possible attributes for a given relation. This is based on the idea that each relation is similar to a unique abstract relation, known as the canonical model. The full set of attributes for the canonical model is then determined. This set can be used to interpret any attribute in a relation through the process of isomorphism.
412046	41204684	Designing Directories in Distributed Systems: A Systematic Framework	In this paper, the authors introduce a framework for designing directory-based distributed applications. They evaluate various directory designs using this framework and provide a case study for a multicast application. The framework is based on a model that extends the concept of "process knowledge" in distributed systems. However, they argue that this definition of knowledge is too strong for many applications and propose a weaker concept of "estimation". They define phrases such as "process p in state s estimates with probability 0.9 that process q is active" and use this concept to specify directory design as an optimization problem. This approach allows for systematic analysis of different directory designs, considering factors such as bandwidth, computation, and storage. This paper contributes to the understanding of distributed systems, directories, and design frameworks, as well as providing a practical tool for performance modeling in multicast applications.
412046	4120467	Verification of distributed systems with local–global predicates	The paper discusses a method for creating and validating distributed systems with both discrete and continuous state spaces. The focus is on systems where only a few components change state while the rest remain unchanged. A proof technique is introduced to ensure overall properties like invariants and convergence by verifying local properties within subsystems. The effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrated through concrete examples. Additionally, a library of theorems and proofs in PVS is provided to aid in developing and verifying programs in this class. The paper also outlines a way to transform these libraries to Java.
412046	41204671	A General Resource Reservation Framework for Scientific Computing	The article discusses three contributions aimed at improving distributed resource allocation in scientific applications. Firstly, an abstract model is introduced where resources are represented as colored tokens and processes acquire these tokens for resource allocation. Secondly, distributed scheduling algorithms are proposed to allow multiple resource managers to customize policies for allocating their specific resources. This enables collaboration between resource managers with different policies to provide resources for the entire system. Lastly, an implementation of a distributed resource scheduling algorithm using Infospheres, a Java-based communication package, is presented to demonstrate the advantages of this approach. Overall, these contributions aim to optimize resource allocation in scientific applications by distributing the responsibility among multiple resource managers.
412047	41204737	View selection for designing the global data warehouse	A global data warehouse collects data from various databases and sources, and can be seen as a collection of materialized views. The selection of which views to materialize is an important decision in the design of the warehouse. However, commercial products do not have automatic tools for this process. To address this, a method is proposed to generate materialized views that satisfy all the input queries. This process is complex as it involves detecting and utilizing common subexpressions. The method also considers the space allocated for materialization and aims to minimize the overall cost of query evaluation and view maintenance. Algorithms have been designed and tested for this purpose.
412047	41204713	Detecting Redundancy in Data Warehouse Evolution	A Data Warehouse (DW) is a collection of materialized views that are used to answer queries. These views are connected through common subexpressions and are constantly evolving. New views may be added and old ones may be dropped to improve query performance. However, this process can result in redundant views. This paper discusses a method for identifying and removing these redundant views without affecting query evaluation or view maintenance. By representing multiple queries and views as an AND/OR dag, the paper proposes a way to detect views that are not necessary for propagating changes from source data to the DW. This method can also be used to identify and utilize common subexpressions between views for efficient propagation of changes.
412047	41204716	Detecting redundant materialized views in data warehouse evolution	A data warehouse is a collection of materialized views, created from remote data sources, to efficiently answer queries. These views are interconnected and change over time, with new ones being added and old ones being dropped. However, this can lead to redundant views that do not affect the query results or maintenance process. This paper presents an algorithm for identifying and removing these redundant views by using common subexpressions and other unaffected views. This approach is independent of cost models and applies to various types of views. By detecting and eliminating redundant views, the data warehouse can be optimized for better performance and cost efficiency.
412048	41204850	V-scope: an opportunistic wardriving approach to augmenting TV whitespace databases	The article discusses the potential of TV whitespaces for wireless communications and the reliance of secondary users on spectrum occupancy databases to determine available channels. However, the accuracy of these databases may be low due to their reliance on propagation models. The authors present V-Scope, a vehicular sensing framework that uses spectrum sensors on public vehicles to collect and report measurements, to evaluate the accuracy of these databases. The system has been deployed on a public transit bus in a mid-sized US city, and the results show that databases tend to overestimate the coverage of certain TV broadcasts, leading to unnecessary blocking of whitespace spectrum in a large area. The authors also suggest using these measurements to improve existing propagation models in databases.
412048	4120486	A vehicle-based measurement framework for enhancing whitespace spectrum databases	The use of spectrum occupancy databases in current TV whitespace networks leads to a significant amount of unused spectrum. This is due to interference from secondary devices and leakage from TV broadcasts, which is not captured by the databases. To address this issue, the use of spectrum measurements is proposed, specifically through a system called V-Scope that utilizes sensors on public vehicles to collect and report data. This system can better determine whitespace spectrum, estimate channel quality, and validate device locations. In a deployment on a metro bus in a US city, it was found that a commercial database under-utilized certain whitespace channels in 71% of locations. V-Scope was able to reclaim this wasted spectrum in 59% of locations and accurately select suitable channels in 72-83% of locations with a localization accuracy of 16-27m.
412048	41204837	A Wireless Spectrum Analyzer in Your Pocket	 1%Snoopy is a proposed system that allows mobile phones and tablets to function as low-cost RF spectrum analyzers. This is beneficial because traditional spectrum analyzers are expensive and difficult to carry around. Snoopy achieves this by attaching a small hardware unit to popular mobile devices, which translates wireless signals into a viewable spectrum. This is done using spectral scan functionality available in certain 802.11 NICs. While not as precise as expensive spectrum analyzers, Snoopy can still effectively detect TV whitespaces (512-698 MHz) with an accuracy of 1%. This allows for quick and easy spectrum sensing while on the go. 
412049	41204951	Proximity theorems of discrete convex functions	A proximity theorem is a statement that states that an optimal solution to an optimization problem can be found within a certain distance from a solution to its relaxation. These theorems have been utilized in developing efficient algorithms for discrete resource allocation problems. This paper focuses on establishing proximity theorems for L2-convex and M2-convex functions, which are important for solving the polymatroid intersection problem and the submodular flow problem. The results of this study build upon previous findings for L-convex and M-convex functions, expanding the scope of application for proximity theorems in solving discrete convex problems.
412049	41204953	Cone superadditivity of discrete convex functions.	A function is considered cone superadditive if it satisfies a specific inequality involving a partition of R n into convex cones. This concept is important in nonlinear integer programming as it can help determine global minimality using local optimality criteria. The paper focuses on L-convex and M-convex functions and proves their cone superadditivity with regard to conic partitions that are not dependent on specific functions. Both discrete and continuous variables are considered.
412049	41204910	A Capacity Scaling Algorithm for M-convex Submodular Flow	The paper introduces a faster algorithm for solving the M-convex submodular flow problem, a variation of the minimum-cost flow problem with a nonlinear discrete convex cost function. This algorithm builds upon a previous approach by Fleischer, Iwata, and McCormick (2002) and incorporates a new technique of adjusting the potential by solving maximum submodular flow problems. This results in improved efficiency and scalability for solving this type of problem. 
412050	41205026	High-performance public-key cryptoprocessor for wireless mobile applications	The article presents a high-speed public-key cryptoprocessor that utilizes three levels of parallelism in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) over GF(2n). It employs a Parallelized Modular Arithmetic Logic Unit (P-MALU) to accelerate modular operations using two types of parallelism. The scalar multiplication sequence is also sped up through the use of Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) and processing multiple P-MALU instructions simultaneously. The system can be programmed for different types of elliptic curves and scalar multiplication algorithms. Synthesis results show that scalar multiplication of ECC over GF(2163) on a generic curve can be computed in 20 and 16 µs with the binary NAF and Montgomery methods, respectively. On a Koblitz curve, the TNAF method can achieve a scalar multiplication of 12 µs. This fast performance enables over 80,000 scalar multiplications per second and enhances security in wireless mobile applications.
412050	41205054	Superscalar coprocessor for high-speed curve-based cryptography	The proposed superscalar coprocessor is designed for fast curve-based cryptography, specifically for accelerating scalar multiplication. By utilizing instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and processing multiple instructions simultaneously, the coprocessor can fully benefit from its superscalar capability. Implementation results demonstrate a significant speed improvement of 1.8, 2.7, and 2.5 times for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) over GF(2163), Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) of genus 2 over GF(283), and ECC over a composite field, GF((283)2), respectively. This is achieved by exploiting parallelism in curve-based cryptography and using a single instruction for all field operations. The coprocessor also allows for efficient point/divisor operations and provides a fair comparison between the three curve-based cryptosystems.
412050	41205049	HW/SW co-design for public-key cryptosystems on the 8051 micro-controller	Implementing large word length public-key algorithms on embedded systems, such as smartcards, RF-ID tags and mobile terminals, is a challenge. This paper presents a solution for RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) over GF(p) on a 12MHz 8-bit 8051 micro-controller. The solution involves a hardware coprocessor with a variable digit size, which can be adapted to the micro-controller's speed and bandwidth. The design process uses the GEZEL system-level design environment to explore the best performance-area combination for the digit size. A case study on an FPGA prototype shows that the proposed solution can achieve a performance 40 times faster than the most optimized software implementation on a small CPU. This is achieved by finding the optimal digit size for the coprocessor. The design also maintains flexibility by using coprocessor instructions, making it a high-performance solution with the flexibility of software on a small CPU.
412051	41205112	Opportunities from Open Source Search	The internet search industry has a successful business model that offers free services to users. This raises the question of why there should be open source search offerings. This paper explores the concept of open source search and explains why the computer science community should be involved. The Alvis Consortium is developing infrastructure for open source search engines using peer-to-peer and subject specific technology. This approach is based on the belief that there is a sufficient supply of open source components for certain tasks. Open source search is seen as a promising area for information extraction and retrieval components and the use of intelligent agents.
412051	41205123	Applying discrete PCA in data analysis	The paper discusses different methods for analyzing principal components in discrete data, including grade of membership modelling, probabilistic latent semantic analysis, and genotype inference with admixture. The authors explore extensions to these methods and their application to various statistical tasks. They also propose a hierarchical version of the methods and additional techniques for Gibbs sampling. The algorithms are compared through a text prediction task and information retrieval. The results show that these methods can be seen as a discrete version of ICA and can be useful for analyzing discrete data in various applications.
412051	41205130	Classifiers: a theoretical and empirical study	This paper discusses a new competitive tree learning algorithm that is based on Bayesian decision theory. The algorithm has been compared to several existing tree learning algorithms and has consistently shown to be as good or better, although at times it may be more computationally expensive. This approach can also be applied to other types of supervised and model learning tasks, as long as a probabilistic representation of the knowledge to be learned is available. The paper also presents a second algorithm for learning Bayesian networks from data and discusses the implications for incremental learning and the use of multiple models.
412052	41205232	Emerging opportunities for theoretical computer science	This report highlights the importance of a strong theoretical foundation in computer science and emphasizes the need for a closer integration between theory and practice. It suggests that the value, impact, and funding of theory can be enhanced if guided by this principle. In order to achieve a greater synergy between theory and application, the report recommends increased financial resources for theory and a closer interaction between theoreticians and researchers in other areas of computer science and other disciplines. It also proposes two applied research initiatives, Information Access in a Globally Distributed Environment and The Algorithmic Stockroom, as well as a broader approach to graduate education to better prepare both theoreticians and practitioners for collaboration. 
412052	4120526	Massively Parallel Symmetry Breaking on Sparse Graphs: MIS and Maximal Matching.	The increasing popularity of massively parallel computation (MPC) paradigms like MapReduce has sparked interest in understanding their true computational capabilities. This has led to a focus on leveraging the advantages of MPC, such as free local computation, to improve the round-complexity of algorithms inherited from traditional parallel and distributed models like PRAM or LOCAL. Maximal independent set (MIS) and maximal matching are two commonly studied problems in this field, with known $O(log n)$ round algorithms since the 1980s. However, recent research has produced an improved MPC algorithm for these problems, with a round complexity of $O(log alpha + log^2log n)$ and truly sublinear space per machine. This algorithm is particularly interesting as it is parameterized by the arboricity of the input graph, a measure that is often small for sparse graphs. This is the first significant improvement over the known algorithms for these problems on a wide range of graphs, and it also outperforms previous PRAM/LOCAL algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm has exponential improvement in terms of $n$, the size of the input graph, compared to previous algorithms. 
412052	41205216	Fair bandwidth allocation without per-flow state	Internet congestion control aims to distribute limited bandwidth fairly among competing flows. This involves the behavior of both routers and end hosts. Routers must decide which packets to drop when links are congested, while end hosts must moderate their transmissions based on acknowledgements of packet delivery. This is typically done according to the TCP protocol. Methods have been proposed to ensure fairness by selectively dropping packets from flows that are receiving more than their fair share of bandwidth. However, these methods either require excessive storage, accurate flow rate estimates, or fail to guarantee fairness. A new algorithm has been proposed that can selectively drop packets without these limitations, with tight bounds on its storage requirements. However, the impact of this algorithm on the global stability of the Internet would require further analysis.
412053	41205344	Testing Planarity of Partially Embedded Graphs	This article discusses the problem of extending a partial planar drawing of a subgraph to a planar drawing of the entire graph. The authors show that this problem remains polynomial-time solvable, thanks to the "TONCAS" behavior which states that the necessary conditions for planarity are also sufficient. This is determined by the rotation system and containment relationships between cycles, as well as the decomposition of the graph into its connected, biconnected, and triconnected components. The authors also introduce a linear-time algorithm for the simultaneous graph drawing problem, where one of the input graphs or the common graph has a fixed planar embedding. However, generalizations of the problem, such as minimizing the number of edges that need to be rerouted, are proven to be NP-hard.
412053	41205385	A Split&Push Approach to 3D Orthogonal Drawing	The article discusses a new approach for creating three-dimensional orthogonal drawings of graphs with a maximum degree of six. The method involves breaking the drawing into smaller pieces and gradually improving its structure until it resembles the final version. The effectiveness of this approach is tested through experiments comparing it to other algorithms. 
412053	41205367	Relaxing the constraints of clustered planarity	A clustered graph drawing consists of points and curves representing vertices and edges, and closed regions representing clusters. A c-planar drawing has no edge-edge, edge-region, or region-region crossings. The complexity of determining if a clustered graph can be c-planar is a longstanding problem in Graph Drawing research. Planarity of the underlying graph is a necessary condition for c-planarity, but not sufficient. A relaxed version of the problem allows for certain types of crossings, and we investigate the minimum number of these crossings for different types of drawings. For biconnected graphs, we can test for a necessary condition in polynomial time. 
412054	41205468	Switch-Regular upward planar embeddings of trees	The problem of determining whether a directed graph can be drawn without any crossings, with all edges flowing upwards, is known as the upward planarity testing problem. This has been extensively studied in past research. A new variation of this problem is introduced in this paper: determining whether a directed graph can be drawn in a specific way, known as a switch-regular upward planar drawing. These drawings have practical applications in developing efficient checkers and compaction strategies. The paper presents a characterization for directed trees that can be drawn in this way and proposes an optimal linear-time algorithm for testing and embedding them.
412054	41205478	Upward-rightward planar drawings	Upward drawing is a commonly used method for representing directed graphs visually. In this convention, vertices are assigned specific points on a plane and edges are drawn as curves that increase vertically according to their direction. However, not all directed graphs can be drawn in this way without any edge crossings, and determining if a graph can be drawn upward planar is a difficult task. To address this, a relaxed version called upward-rightward drawing has been studied. In this type of drawing, every directed path must either go upward or to the right. The paper shows that this type of drawing can be achieved for all planar directed graphs with straight-line edges in linear time and polynomial area. 
412054	41205411	Book Embeddings and Point-Set Embeddings of Series-Parallel Digraphs	The article presents an efficient algorithm that can compute an upward two-page book embedding of a series-parallel digraph with n vertices in O(n) time. This is an improvement from a previous algorithm which had a time complexity of O(n3) and did not work for digraphs with transitive edges. The paper also shows that series-parallel graphs are sub-hamiltonian, extending a previous result for a subset of planar series-parallel graphs. The article also discusses the upward point-set embedding problem, which involves mapping planar digraphs onto a set of points in the plane with upward edges and at most one bend per edge. The paper proves the equivalence between this problem and computing an upward two-page book embedding, and presents an O(n log n)-time algorithm for solving it for planar series-parallel digraphs.
412055	4120553	Clustering cycles into cycles of clusters	The paper focuses on studying clustered graphs with a cycle as their underlying graph. The researchers specifically look at 3-cluster cycles, which have three clusters at the same level. They demonstrate that testing for c-planarity, or the ability to draw the graph without crossing edges, can be efficiently done for this type of clustered graph. A drawing algorithm is also provided. The researchers also use formal grammars to characterize 3-cluster cycles. The study is then expanded to include clustered graphs with a cycle structure at each level of the inclusion tree, and the same efficient c-planarity testing and drawing algorithms are shown to apply.
412055	41205537	Relaxing the constraints of clustered planarity	A clustered graph is a visual representation of data where vertices are represented as points and edges as curves, and clusters are shown as closed regions. A c-planar drawing of a clustered graph has no crossings between edges, regions, or edges and regions. The complexity of determining if a clustered graph can have a c-planar drawing is a long-standing unsolved problem in Graph Drawing research. It is known that for a c-planar drawing, the underlying graph must be planar, but this is not a sufficient condition. To better understand the problem, a relaxed version allows for some types of crossings. It is possible to have a drawing with only edge-edge or edge-region crossings, but not necessarily with only region-region crossings. Upper and lower bounds have been established for the minimum number of crossings in these types of drawings. A polynomial-time algorithm is also provided for testing if a drawing with only region-region crossings exists for a certain type of graph. This condition can be tested in polynomial time for a significant class of graphs.
412055	41205554	Splitting clusters to get c-planarity	The paper introduces a new problem called Split-C-Planarity for clustered graphs, which aims to minimize the number of clusters that need to be split in order to make the graph c-planar. This problem is NP-complete for certain types of clustered graphs, but a polynomial-time algorithm is presented for a specific type of clustered graph with certain conditions. The results show that the complexity of the problem depends on the connectivity of the clusters and the underlying graph structure.
412056	4120561	On cost-aware monitoring for self-adaptive load sharing	This paper discusses the tradeoff between the utility of monitoring and its cost in self-adaptive load sharing systems, where a stream of jobs is distributed among a group of servers. The authors propose a model called Extended Supermarket Model (ESM) to determine the optimal number of servers to be monitored for minimal service time at an optimal cost. They also present self-adaptive load-sharing algorithms for centralized and distributed settings, and evaluate them using simulations and a real testbed. The results show that self-adaptive load balancing is more effective than cost-oblivious mechanisms, and the proposed algorithms perform well in a distributed setting without a dedicated monitoring component.
412056	41205629	Travelling Miser Problem	n this paper, the authors propose a new framework for handling low priority but resource-consuming traffic. This framework allows the network nodes to delay data by storing it locally, which improves the network's goodput without interfering with higher priority traffic. The authors also provide an optimization problem and enhanced scheduling strategy to ensure minimal cost schedules and flexible timing constraints for management traffic. The proposed framework is evaluated through a simulation study and demonstrates improved network performance with no difference in priority between user and management traffic.
412056	41205656	The traveling miser problem	This paper proposes a new framework for handling low priority but resource-consuming traffic in a way that minimizes interference with higher priority traffic and improves network goodput. The key idea is to allow network nodes to locally delay data, which can be implemented in the Active Network paradigm. The paper shows that this approach can significantly improve goodput, even with a simple scheduling algorithm for intermediate parking. To minimize costs, the paper introduces the traveling miser problem and develops enhanced scheduling strategies. Through simulation, the paper proves the competitiveness of the algorithm under different assumptions on the network environment, with an O(log2B) competitive ratio for congested links and 3-competitive ratio with additional signaling. 
412057	41205732	Addressing the challenges of future large-scale many-core architectures	The current trend in processors is to have more cores with varying characteristics, allowing for higher performance in different applications. However, effectively utilizing these processors is a challenge, as assuming all cores are the same for scheduling tasks is no longer valid. To address this, a task assignment policy is proposed that takes into account the different characteristics of cores, such as their grouping and distance from memory controllers. This policy also allows for task migration to optimize both execution time and power consumption. The paper outlines the assignment algorithm and how it will be implemented on a many-core system.
412057	4120570	Using Personality Metrics to Improve Cache Interference Management in Multicore Processors.	As processors continue to increase in the number of cores, there are challenges that arise, such as increased competition for shared resources like the Last-Level Cache (LLC). This is particularly relevant in scenarios like Data Centers, where Decision Support System queries are commonly executed. In this study, the focus is on the cache interference while executing these queries using a multicore processor with up to 16 cores and different LLC configurations. To better understand the effects of co-execution, two new metrics are developed - social and sensitive - to classify the behavior of the queries. These metrics can be used to manage cache interference and improve the overall performance of co-executing queries. 
412057	41205711	Watt Matters Most? Design Space Exploration of High-Performance Microprocessors for Power-Performance Efficiency	Computer systems have greatly advanced in recent years, resulting in high-performance systems. However, this has also led to a significant increase in power consumption. As a result, power efficiency has become a crucial factor in processor design. To better understand the power and performance behavior of different processor components, a study was conducted on various high-end microarchitecture configurations using three workloads: multimedia, scientific, and database. The objectives were to compare efficiency, identify sensitive parameters, and propose efficient configurations for each workload. The results showed that multimedia achieved the highest efficiency, while the database workload was most sensitive to parameter changes. The correct configuration of parameters is crucial, as even a single careless change can result in a 99% decrease in efficiency. Careful tuning of multiple parameters can lead to a 154% increase in efficiency compared to the baseline configuration.
412058	41205819	A relational symbolic execution algorithm for constraint-based testing of database programs	Constraint-based program testing involves using symbolic execution to generate test data for a specific execution path in a program. This technique can be applied to different paths in the code to automatically generate suitable test sets for code units. To improve the reliability of software, this technique can be generalized for programs that manipulate databases. A proposed relational symbolic execution algorithm for testing simple Java methods that interact with a relational database is described. This algorithm models the database tables and method variables as constrained relational variables and uses Alloy constraints to generate test cases. A tool implementing this algorithm is demonstrated with examples.
412058	41205845	A Symbolic Execution Algorithm for Constraint-Based Testing of Database Programs.	Constraint-based testing is a method used to generate test data for imperative programs, with symbolic execution being a commonly used technique. As databases are prevalent in software, testing database programs is crucial for ensuring reliability. This study proposes and experiments with a symbolic execution algorithm specifically designed for constraint-based testing of database programs. The algorithm works by modeling the program and database interactions using a formal language called SimpleDB, and generating path constraints for testing purposes. The results of the study show that the proposed algorithm is effective in generating test inputs that guarantee adherence to specific paths in the program.
412058	41205820	Test input generation for database programs using relational constraints	Databases are crucial components in software, making it necessary to test programs that use them in order to ensure reliability. This article proposes a unified approach to automatically generate test inputs for database programs. The approach involves using a formal language, called ImperDB, to model database programs and their interactions with databases. A static analysis technique is then applied to generate test inputs based on chosen criteria. This technique views the program as a series of operations on relational variables, representing both the original database content and program inputs. The problem of finding test inputs to execute a specific path is transformed into solving constraints using the Alloy language and analyzer.
412059	41205934	Web Application Security Using JSFlow.	Web applications are commonly targeted by code injection attacks and attacks through buggy or malicious libraries. However, current protection measures are often ad-hoc and reactive, resulting in a variety of specialized but fragile mechanisms. This abstract introduces JSFlow, an information-flow aware interpreter for web application security, which focuses on controlling what applications can do with accessed information rather than just restricting access. This removes the need for trust in entities with granted access, making it more resilient to bypassing by third party code and code injection attacks. Through two practical attacks on a web application called Hrafn, the effectiveness of JSFlow is demonstrated. It provides a consistent defense against untrustworthy and malicious code, ensuring confidentiality of sensitive data. 
412059	41205937	May I? - Content Security Policy Endorsement for Browser Extensions	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are a major issue on the web, and one way to combat them is through Content Security Policy (CSP). However, the adoption of CSP has been slow due to its interaction with browser extensions. A study of free extensions from Google's Chrome web store revealed three types of vulnerabilities caused by the conflict between extensions and CSP: third party code inclusion, enabling XSS, and user profiling. Some extensions with millions of users were found to be vulnerable. To promote the use of CSP, the authors propose an extension-aware CSP endorsement mechanism between the server and client, which was demonstrated to be effective in a case study with the Rapportive extensions for Firefox and Chrome.
412059	41205914	Data Exfiltration in the Face of CSP.	Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are a persistent issue on the internet. Content Security Policy (CSP) is a solution that restricts the capabilities of code on a web page to mitigate the effects of XSS. However, there is a disagreement within the security community about the effectiveness of CSP in preventing data leaks. This paper highlights the problem of data exfiltration in the context of CSP and reveals flaws in current protection mechanisms. A case study shows that data can still be exfiltrated through DNS prefetching and resource prefetching despite CSP. The study also examines the prevalence of CSP and prefetching on popular websites. Possible solutions to control data exfiltration are discussed, including immediate fixes and extensions to CSP.
412060	41206038	LCO-MAC: A Low Latency, Low Control Overhead MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) often use a duty-cycling scheme in their medium access control (MAC) protocol to reduce energy consumption. However, this scheme can lead to high end-to-end latency and control packet overhead. To address this issue, a new MAC protocol called LCO-MAC has been proposed. This protocol allows a DATA packet to be transmitted through multiple hops in a single duty cycle, reducing end-to-end latency. Additionally, one control packet can serve multiple roles, acting as an RTS and CTS in the initial transmission period and as an ACK during actual data transmission. Simulations have shown that LCO-MAC improves energy efficiency and decreases end-to-end latency compared to the current RMAC protocol. 
412060	41206024	Collaborative Distributed Admission Control (CDAC) for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks	The paper discusses the importance of admission control algorithms in ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for multimedia applications over wireless home networks. It proposes a framework for performing distributed admission control in a collaborative wireless environment, where a wireless device will not add a new flow if it would impact the resources for existing flows. The paper also suggests modifications to the 802.11x network to increase bandwidth efficiency and provides performance analysis for multiple flows with different throughput requirements. Based on this analysis, two distributed admission control algorithms are proposed and their performance is confirmed through simulations.
412060	4120605	Asynchronous MAC protocol with QoS awareness in wireless sensor networks	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) utilize MAC protocols to conserve energy and extend network lifetime. One such protocol, Receiver-Initiated MAC (RI-MAC), schedules transmissions based on receivers, resulting in good latency but high energy consumption for senders. To handle the variation in traffic, MAC protocols must have QoS mechanisms. This paper proposes AQ-MAC, an asynchronous MAC protocol with QoS awareness. AQ-MAC uses the receiver-initiated approach and provides QoS per packet based on priority. It also employs a packet concatenation scheme to enhance energy efficiency. Evaluations using ns-2 show that AQ-MAC performs well in different traffic scenarios, with good energy efficiency and latency performance.
412061	41206114	Collaborative Distributed Admission Control (CDAC) for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks	Admission control algorithms have been studied extensively to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for multimedia applications over wired Internet. As wireless home networks become more prevalent, it is important to utilize these mechanisms to improve the performance of wireless multimedia applications. This paper proposes a framework for distributed admission control in a collaborative wireless environment, where a device will not add a new flow if it would compromise existing flows due to resource limitations. The authors suggest a modification to 802.11x networks to increase bandwidth efficiency, provide a performance analysis for networks with multiple flows, and propose two distributed admission control algorithms based on transmission opportunity and contention window. Simulation results support the theoretical predictions of the proposed algorithms.
412061	41206110	Video Streaming with Network Coding	The popularity of multimedia streaming applications over the Internet has increased rapidly in recent years. Two effective methods for delivering these contents are Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. One common feature of these networks is their ability to support path diversity streaming, where a receiver can receive multiple streams from different paths. This paper proposes a network coding framework for efficient video streaming in CDNs and P2P networks, using multiple servers/peers to stream to a single receiver. This technique eliminates the need for synchronization between senders, integrates easily with TCP, and reduces server storage in CDNs. The Hierarchical Network Coding (HNC) is also proposed for use with scalable video bit streams to combat bandwidth fluctuations. Simulations show that this network coding approach can result in up to 60% bandwidth savings compared to traditional methods.
412061	41206112	Collaborative Distributed Admission Control (CDAC) for Wireless Network	This paper presents a framework for distributed admission control in a collaborative wireless environment. The proposed approach prevents a wireless device from introducing a new flow if there are insufficient resources to support existing flows. The authors suggest a modification to 802.11x networks to improve bandwidth efficiency, eliminating the need to double the contention window size after a collision. They also provide a performance analysis for these modified networks with multiple flows of varying throughput requirements. Based on this analysis, they propose two distributed admission control algorithms using the transmission opportunity and contention window size. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of these algorithms.
412062	4120621	Designing core ontologies	The lack of a formal basis for modeling complex, structured knowledge in distributed information systems hinders their integration. To address this issue, the use of core ontologies is proposed. These ontologies are highly axiomatized and based on foundational principles, making them precise and modular. They also allow for the reuse and integration of existing domain knowledge. Three core ontologies have been developed for events and objects, multimedia annotations, and personal information management. These ontologies can be simultaneously used and integrated in a complex socio-technical system such as emergency response. The design approach, lessons learned, and aesthetic aspects of these core ontologies are discussed.
412062	41206219	A core ontology on events for representing occurrences in the real world	The paper discusses the importance of events in semantic ambient media applications and highlights the limitations of existing event models. To address these issues, the authors present the Event-Model-F, a formal model based on the ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralite. This model allows for a comprehensive representation of various aspects of events, such as time, space, objects, and relationships between events. It is developed using a pattern-oriented ontology design approach and can be easily extended for specific domains. The paper also describes the implementation of an application programming interface for easy integration of the Event-Model-F in different applications. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated through its application in a socio-technical system for emergency response.
412062	4120625	MetaXa—Context- and content-driven metadata enhancement for personal photo books	Creating a personalized photo book for a loved one can be a time-consuming process, requiring careful selection and arrangement of pictures. While some companies offer the option to directly print and bind a photo book, the task of selecting and arranging photos remains tedious for those using album creation software. The lack of easy suggestions for selecting and arranging photos makes this process even more challenging. To address this issue, MetaXa proposes a flexible software architecture that allows for the extraction and enhancement of metadata for personal media content. This approach makes it easier to select and arrange photos, as well as to customize the process for different applications. MetaXa has been successfully applied to photo book creation by CeWe Color and evaluated on a large set of consumer photos.
412063	41206342	Siamese: scalable and incremental code clone search via multiple code representations	The paper introduces a new code clone search technique, called Siamese, which is accurate, incremental, and scalable to large code bases. Siamese utilizes multiple code representations, query reduction, and a custom ranking function to improve performance. It outperforms seven other clone detection tools with a 95% and 99% mean average precision on two clone benchmarks and can detect the largest number of Type-3 clones compared to other code search engines. Siamese is also scalable, able to search through 365 million lines of code in just 8 seconds. The paper also discusses two use cases for Siamese, online code clone detection and clone search with automated license analysis.
412063	41206313	Comparative stability of cloned and non-cloned code: an empirical study	Code cloning is a practice in software engineering that has been a topic of controversy due to conflicting claims about its impact on software maintenance. Recently, a new measurement technique called code stability has been introduced to assess the effect of code cloning by measuring the changeability of a code region. While previous studies have generally found that cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code, they have been limited in their scope and methodology. In this paper, the authors present a comprehensive study on code stability using three different measurement methods and a diverse set of subject systems written in multiple programming languages. Their findings show that the type of cloning, programming language, system size and age, and development strategy all play a role in the stability of cloned code. Additionally, they find that there is no consistent change pattern between cloned and non-cloned code regions within a system. 
412063	41206347	A Study of Consistent and Inconsistent Changes to Code Clones	Code cloning is a concern in software maintenance because it is believed that changes made to one cloned section of code must also be applied to other clones within the same group. However, there is limited evidence to support this belief. This paper presents a study on changes made to code clones in open source software systems. The results show that about half of the changes to code clone groups are inconsistent, meaning they are not applied to all clones. Additionally, the study found that if there are inconsistent changes in a code clone group in a specific version, it is unlikely that there will be consistent changes in later versions.
412064	41206460	Improving Color Constancy by Photometric Edge Weighting	Edge-based color constancy methods use image derivatives to estimate the illuminant. Different edge types, such as material, shadow, and highlight edges, exist in real-world images and can greatly affect the performance of illuminant estimation. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of different edge types on edge-based color constancy methods. A taxonomy is introduced to classify edge types based on their photometric properties, followed by a performance evaluation using these edge types. The results show that specular and shadow edges are more important for illuminant estimation than material edges. To address this, the paper proposes an iterative weighted Gray-Edge algorithm that emphasizes these edge types. Results from images in controlled and uncontrolled environments demonstrate improved performance compared to regular edge-based methods, with reductions in median angular error of up to 25% and 11%, respectively. 
412064	41206422	Edge-Based Color Constancy	Color constancy is the ability to measure the colors of objects regardless of the color of the light source. The gray-world assumption is a well-known method for achieving color constancy, which assumes that the average reflectance of objects in the world is achromatic. In this paper, a new hypothesis called the gray-edge hypothesis is proposed, which assumes that the average difference in edges within a scene is achromatic. This leads to the development of a new algorithm for color constancy, which is based on the derivative structure of images rather than the traditional zero-order structure. A framework is also proposed that combines various known color constancy methods with the new gray-edge algorithm. The performance of this framework is tested on two large datasets and compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing comparable results with the added benefit of being more computationally efficient.
412064	4120643	Color constancy based on the Grey-edge hypothesis.	The Grey-World assumption, which states that the average reflectance of surfaces in the world is achromatic, is a well-known method for color constancy. However, a new hypothesis called the Grey-Edge hypothesis suggests that the average difference in edges in a scene is achromatic. This leads to a more general version of the Grey-Edge hypothesis, which assumes that the Minkowski norm of derivatives of reflectance is achromatic. An algorithm based on this hypothesis is proposed and tested on a large dataset, showing superior performance compared to the Grey-World assumption and the max-RGB method. The results are comparable to more complex algorithms, but with lower computational costs.
412065	41206544	Near-Optimal Distributed Maximum Flow	We have developed a distributed algorithm that can efficiently approximate single-commodity maximum flow in undirected weighted networks. It runs in a nearly optimal number of communication rounds, (D + root n) . n(o(1)), in the CONGEST model. This is a significant improvement over the previous bound of O(n(2)) and is close to the lower bound of (Omega) over tilde (D + root n). The algorithm involves two key results: a distributed construction of a spanning tree with average stretch n(o(1)) in (D + root n) . n(o(1)) rounds, and a distributed construction of an n(o(1))-congestion approximator using O(logn) virtual trees. The algorithm uses randomization and has a high probability of success.
412065	4120657	Distributed connectivity decomposition	The paper discusses the issue of congestion and information flow in distributed network algorithms. It presents time-efficient algorithms for decomposing graphs with high edge or vertex connectivity into multiple spanning or dominating trees, allowing for a flow close to the connectivity. The algorithms have round complexity of ~O(D+√n) and ~{O}(D+√nλ) for vertex-connectivity and edge-connectivity respectively. Lower bounds of ~](D+√n/k) and ~Ω(D+√n/λ) are also shown, and the vertex-connectivity decomposition can be applied to centralized algorithms. These results have implications for centralized approximation of vertex connectivity and distributed algorithms for oblivious broadcast routing. 
412065	4120656	Distributed Minimum Cut Approximation	The article discusses the problem of finding approximate minimum edge cuts through distributed algorithms. The CONGEST model is used, where a maximum of O(log n) bits can be transmitted over each edge per round. The first algorithm uses a new method called the random layering technique and has a high probability of finding a cut of size O(epsilon(-1)lambda) in O(D) + (O) over tilde (n(1/2+epsilon)) rounds. The second algorithm is based on a centralized algorithm and can compute a cut of size at most (2 + epsilon)lambda in (O) over tilde((D + root n)/epsilon(5)) rounds. These algorithms nearly match the lower bound of (Omega) over tilde (D + root n) and also extend it to unweighted graphs.
412066	41206631	Serving Online Requests with Mobile Servers.	This study focuses on an online problem where mobile servers must be moved to efficiently serve a set of online requests. There are n nodes and k servers that can be moved between them. Requests are issued one at a time and must be served continuously. The cost of serving requests is determined by the number of servers and requests at each node. The algorithm must ensure that the service cost remains within a certain factor and an additive term of the optimal cost. Two minimization objectives are considered: minimizing server movements and minimizing total cost. It is proven that for every k, the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm must be at least Omega(n). However, by extending the objective to include current service cost, a competitive ratio of 1+epsilon can be achieved with a linearly increasing additive term for every constant epsilon > 0.
412066	41206654	Bounding interference in wireless ad hoc networks with nodes in random position	The interference minimization problem in wireless networks involves assigning transmission radius or power levels to nodes to ensure a connected communication graph while minimizing interference. The model introduced by von Rickenbach et al. (2005) uses balls to represent transmission ranges and symmetric edges in the graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete in two dimensions and has no known polynomial-time approximation algorithm. However, in this paper, the authors propose a solution for this problem in typical wireless ad hoc network settings. They show that the topology of the closure of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of randomly selected node positions has a maximum interference of O(logn) with high probability. This bound is extended to a broader set of probability distributions and a local algorithm is presented to construct the graph with an upper bound on expected maximum interference. An empirical evaluation of the algorithm through simulation is also provided.
412066	41206628	Serving Online Demands with Movable Centers.	This study focuses on an online problem where a group of mobile resources need to be moved to efficiently serve a set of demands. There are n nodes and k resources, and the resources can be moved between the nodes. Demands arrive at the nodes in an online manner, and the cost of serving them depends on the number of resources and demands at each node. The goal is to minimize the total number of resource movements while keeping the service cost low. A deterministic online algorithm is proposed with guarantees for the service cost to be within a certain factor of the optimal cost, and the movement cost to be within a small factor of the optimal overall cost. The algorithm's performance is also shown to be nearly optimal.
412067	41206737	Frequent subgraph summarization with error control	Frequent subgraph mining is an important but challenging problem in research. The large number of discovered subgraphs makes it difficult to analyze and understand the patterns. This paper proposes a summarization model that uses an independence probabilistic model to accurately restore frequent subgraphs and their frequencies. The model allows users to specify an error tolerance and uses a top-down approach to discover summarization templates while keeping the frequency restoration error within the tolerance. Experiments on real graph datasets show that the model can effectively control the error within 10% with a concise summary.
412067	41206771	Succinct summarization of transactional databases: an overlapped hyperrectangle scheme	Transactional data, which are commonly found in databases, have been analyzed using methods such as frequent itemsets mining and co-clustering. However, there is a new research problem of succinctly summarizing these databases by linking the high level structure to a large number of frequent itemsets. This problem is formulated as a set covering problem using overlapped hyperrectangles and has been proven to be NP-hard. A polynomial time approximation algorithm called HYPER with a ln(k) + 1 approximation ratio has been developed, along with a pruning strategy to speed up processing. An efficient algorithm has also been proposed to summarize hyperrectangles by allowing false positive conditions. Real and synthetic datasets have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these approaches.
412067	41206764	Summarizing transactional databases with overlapped hyperrectangles	Transactional data is data that records transactions, such as purchases or interactions, and is found in many different databases. To analyze these databases, researchers have developed methods like frequent itemset mining and co-clustering. However, a new problem has been proposed: how to summarize these databases in a concise way. This requires connecting the database's structure to numerous frequent itemsets. The problem is formulated as a set covering problem and is proven to be NP-hard. An approximation algorithm called Hyper is developed, along with a pruning strategy to speed up the process. Another algorithm, Hyper+, is proposed to summarize the hyperrectangles using false positive conditions. The generated hyperrectangles can also be visualized. Real and synthetic datasets were used to show the effectiveness and efficiency of these approaches.
412068	41206889	Robust face pose classification method based on geometry-preserving visual phrase	Developing a feature for accurately classifying facial poses is a difficult task due to the varying spatial layouts of key facial points. To address this challenge, a pose classification framework using local geometry-preserving visual phrases (GVP) is proposed. This framework includes a weighting strategy on GVP that improves the discriminability of individual words and spatial layouts within high order phrases. This results in a flexible and robust method that can account for multiple factors affecting facial poses. Experimental results on two databases demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to other methods such as PCA, LDA, and tf-idf weighted Bag-of-Words.
412068	412068157	A jointly distributed semi-supervised topic model	Latent topic models are commonly used to analyze the underlying semantic meaning of documents and images, particularly in object categorization. However, these models lack the ability to ensure that the learned topics are relevant to class labels. Manually aligning and labeling training images is expensive and subjective, making it impractical for real-world applications. To address this issue, this paper introduces a semi-supervised approach that uses a small amount of partial labels to generate more suitable topics for classification. The proposed method, which incorporates joint distribution from multi-conditional learning, includes semi-supervised LDA and pLSA models. Experimental results on natural scene categorization and head pose classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing promising results even with only partial labels in the training process. 
412068	412068164	Non-rigid target tracking based on 'flow-cut' in pair-wise frames with online hough forests	Conventional online learning methods use fixed-shape appearance modeling for training samples generation, which can be problematic for non-rigid and articulated objects as it may include background areas as foreground. Recent studies have attempted to address this issue by using multiple patches and foreground segmentation, but they only consider single frame information and struggle with similar backgrounds. This work proposes a new model that incorporates motion information between consecutive frames to accurately segment non-rigid targets. This model is then integrated into a semi-supervised online tracking framework, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness in challenging videos. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to other state-of-the-art tracking methods.
412069	4120696	A Visual Silence Detector Constraining Speech Source Separation	We propose a method for separating speech signals using audio and visual information. Our algorithm first identifies periods of low mouth activity in video recordings and uses a classifier to detect silent intervals during these moments. The source separation problem is then solved for the entire recording. We tested our approach on two speech corpora with two speakers and two microphones, one with simulated room mixing and one with recorded conversations. The results were positive, with the use of the visual silence detector improving the performance of the source separation algorithm. This method shows potential for enhancing speech separation in audiovisual recordings.
412069	41206971	A Segmentation Framework For Phase Contrast And Fluorescence Microscopy Images	Imaging living cells without staining them is a commonly used technique in biotechnology for studying protein function. This method, called noninvasive imaging, allows for the observation of living specimens without altering them. Fluorescence and contrast images are typically used together to achieve better results. However, segmenting contrast images is challenging due to defocused scans, lighting artifacts, and overlapping cells. In this study, the researchers investigated the optical properties involved in image formation and proposed segmentation strategies that take advantage of these properties. Their proposed approach combines phase and fluorescence information and uses a specialized contour model to accurately segment cell images. The results of their experiments support the effectiveness of this strategy for cell image segmentation.
412069	41206985	A High Resolution Bladder Wall Map: Feasibility Study	This study aims to develop a system that can automatically reconstruct 2D and 3D images of the bladder wall to assist urologists in treating bladder cancer and planning and documenting interventions. A pilot study was conducted using a special endoscope with a laser-based distance measurement, an optical navigation system, and image stitching techniques to determine if a bladder wall model could be created. Results from experiments with a realistic bladder phantom showed that this concept is feasible and can be expanded upon to create a real-time system for automatic bladder wall reconstruction during surgical procedures.
412070	4120702	If: An Intermediate Representation For Sdl And Its Applications	The project discussed is focused on improving a specification/validation toolbox by integrating a commercial toolset called ObjectGEODE with other validation tools like CADP and TGV. Due to the complexity of most protocol specifications, the project has explored combining techniques such as static analysis, abstraction, and model-checking. This has resulted in the development of an intermediate representation for SDL called IF, which represents systems as timed automata communicating asynchronously through buffers or synchronization gates. This intermediate representation allows for easier integration with existing tools and provides a way to define different notions of time for SDL. The project's results have been validated through experimentation.
412070	41207057	Automated Validation of Distributed Software Using the IF Environment	The paper discusses IF, an open validation environment designed for distributed software systems. Due to the complexity of these systems, no single tool can effectively cover the entire validation process. IF was created with an intermediate language and can connect multiple validation tools, incorporating advanced techniques. The practicality of this approach was confirmed through successful results on various case studies, such as telecommunication protocols and embedded software systems.
412070	41207013	Verification and test generation for the SSCOP protocol	The article discusses the use of formal tools in analyzing and verifying large systems. It notes that while these tools are efficient for small-to-medium systems, they are not sufficient for larger systems. Instead, a combination of tools should be used, with each tool focusing on its specific strengths and using the results to enhance the applicability of other tools. The article presents a case study where two research teams and a software engineering tools maker collaborated to analyze, verify, and automatically generate tests for an industrial protocol. The success of this approach provides insights into a potential methodology for formally validating large systems.
412071	41207164	The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective	The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge is a benchmark for image recognition algorithms, consisting of a dataset with annotations and standardized evaluation software, as well as an annual competition and workshop. The challenge has five categories: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. This paper reviews the challenge from 2008-2012, providing insights for both algorithm designers and challenge organizers. The authors introduce new evaluation methods, such as bootstrapping and normalized average precision, to compare algorithm performance. They also analyze the progress of the community and identify common errors. The paper concludes with recommendations for future challenges and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the VOC challenge.
412071	41207149	Renewal Strings for Cleaning Astronomical Databases.	The SuperCOSMOS Sky Surveys (SSS) and other large astronomical databases often contain false records due to various factors such as telescope errors and orbiting objects. These records can be a significant issue for astronomers, as they can make up a large portion of potentially relevant data. A new technique called renewal strings, which combines the Hough transform, renewal processes, and hidden Markov models, has been developed to effectively address this problem. This method has been successfully applied to the SSS data, creating a dataset of false detections with confidence measures that can be used to filter out unwanted data. These methods are adaptable to other astronomical survey data. 
412071	41207139	Dataset Issues in Object Recognition	Object recognition research relies heavily on having appropriate datasets for tasks such as learning visual models, detecting and localizing objects, and evaluating algorithm performance. However, current datasets have limitations and this paper explores lessons learned from existing efforts and proposes new methods for obtaining large and diverse annotated datasets. Criteria for gathering future datasets are also suggested. 
412072	4120721	Ramsey-Type Results for Unions of Comparability Graphs	The comparability graph of a partially ordered set with $n$ elements always contains either a clique or an independent set of size $\sqrt{n}$. This also applies to graphs that are the combination of two comparability graphs on the same set of vertices, where the minimum size of a clique or independent set is $n^{1 \over 3}$. However, there are cases where the size of these sets is no more than $n^{0.4118}$. This same pattern holds for graphs that are unions of a fixed number $k$ comparability graphs, as well as for unions of perfect graphs.
412072	4120724	New Bounds on Crossing Numbers	The crossing number, cr(G), of a graph G is the minimum number of crossing points in any drawing of the graph in the plane. The minimum crossing number for graphs with n vertices and at least e edges, denoted by (n; e), is shown to tend to a positive constant as n approaches infinity and n e approaches n2=e3. This holds for graph drawings on any surface with a fixed genus. Better bounds are proven for graphs with certain monotone properties, such as not containing a cycle of length four or six. Specifically, for graphs with n vertices and e 4n edges, the crossing number is at least ce4=n3 (resp ce=n4), where c > 0 is a constant. This answers a question posed by M Simonovits.
412072	41207224	Disjointness Graphs of Segments.	The disjointness graph of a set of segments in $R^d$ is a graph where each segment is a vertex and two vertices are connected if the corresponding segments are disjoint. The chromatic number of this graph is at most the clique number to the fourth power plus the cube of the clique number. This means that for a set of segments, there are at least $n^{1/5}$ pairwise intersecting or disjoint elements. Similar results are found for lines in space, but computing the clique number and chromatic number of these graphs is NP-hard. However, efficient algorithms can be used to compute proper colorings with a limited number of colors. This does not apply to sets of continuous arcs, as there are cases where the disjointness graph is triangle-free but has an arbitrarily large chromatic number.
412073	41207390	Efficient Object Detection and Segmentation for Fine-Grained Recognition	This article presents a new algorithm for detecting and segmenting objects in images for fine-grained recognition. The algorithm first identifies potential object regions and then segments the entire object using propagation. Additionally, the algorithm can zoom in on the object, center it, and normalize it for scale to improve recognition accuracy. The algorithm was tested on various datasets and showed significant improvements in performance, especially for difficult datasets such as bird species. It is more efficient than other methods and has been successfully applied to different types of objects. The algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods by as much as 11% on benchmark datasets and consistently improves the performance of a baseline algorithm by 3-4%. It also showed a 4% improvement on a large-scale flower dataset with 578 species and 250,000 images. 
412073	41207347	Regionlets for Generic Object Detection	Generic object detection is a challenging task due to variations in different object classes and the need for efficient computations. To address this, a cascaded boosting classifier is proposed, which integrates regionlets - base feature extraction regions that are defined proportionally to the detection window at various resolutions. These regionlets are organized in groups to capture fine-grained spatial layouts within objects and their features are aggregated to tolerate deformations. The proposed method also utilizes segmentation cues to generate object bounding box proposals, limiting evaluation to thousands of locations. This approach achieves competitive performance on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets without using any contextual information. Further, the use of support pixel integral images and deep convolutional neural networks improves performance on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Object Recognition Challenge.
412073	41207330	Similarity Learning via Adaptive Regression and Its Application to Image Retrieval	The article discusses the problem of similarity learning and its application to image retrieval with large-scale data. In order to measure the similarity between images, the distances between their high dimensional representations are used. This is typically addressed through distance metric learning, but this can be computationally expensive and not necessary for the retrieval ranking problem. To address this issue, the article proposes the use of a bilinear model, which is more flexible for large-scale image retrieval. By adaptively updating the target matrix in a regression framework, the method can effectively mimic the appropriate loss function for similarity learning. To handle computational challenges, the article suggests compressing data using a randomized algorithm and using a low rank assumption and alternating method to obtain a partial matrix with a global optimal solution. Empirical studies on real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
412074	41207410	Multi-Output Regularized Feature Projection	Dimensionality reduction by feature projection is a widely used technique in pattern recognition, information retrieval, and statistics. When there are available outputs, it is beneficial to consider supervised projection, which takes into account both the inputs and target values. This is especially useful in applications with multiple outputs, where several tasks need to be learned simultaneously. In this paper, a new approach called Multi-Output Regularized feature Projection (MORP) is introduced, which preserves input information and captures correlations between inputs and outputs. By using a latent variable model and solving a generalized eigenvalue problem, this approach can greatly improve prediction accuracy and has shown promising results in predicting user preferences for paintings and image/text categorization.

Experimental results on two text corpora showed that this new approach outperforms the traditional greedy method and has potential for active text categorization tasks.
412074	4120742	Learning multiple graphs for document recommendations	This paper addresses the issue of document recommendation in a digital library, where the documents are connected by citations and various relations. Due to the sparsity and noise of individual graphs, a new method is proposed to combine multiple graphs and measure document similarities. The method uses different factorization strategies based on the nature of the graphs and seeks a low-dimensional embedding to capture relative similarities. A recommendation framework is developed using semi-supervised learning on graphs. An incremental algorithm is also proposed to address scalability, which significantly improves efficiency by only calculating the embedding for new documents. Experiments on real world datasets show improved quality and efficiency for the batch and incremental methods.

412075	412075160	Network intrusion detection by combining one-class classifiers	Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are crucial for network security. Their goal is to detect intrusion attempts and promptly notify the network administrator for appropriate action. This paper presents a misuse-based Network Intrusion Detection architecture that utilizes multiple one-class classifiers. Each classifier is trained to distinguish a specific attack from other traffic patterns. As attacks can be categorized, several one-class classifiers are trained for each attack class. This architecture combines the outputs of these classifiers to create a more comprehensive IDS with generalized attack signatures. The goal is to label a pattern as normal or belonging to a specific attack class. The effectiveness of this approach is explored and discussed.
412076	41207676	PHY modulation/rate control for fountain codes in 802.11a/g WLANs.	The paper examines the combined performance of fountain codes and 802.11a/g PHY modulation and coding. Both theoretical and experimental channel models are considered, with a focus on maximizing goodput and minimizing energy. Unlike studies in cellular networks, it is found that in 802.11a/g WLANs, a cross-layer approach of using higher-layer fountain coding with PHY layer modulation and FEC coding does not result in significant improvements. The optimal PHY modulation/rate for uncoded multicast traffic is also similar to that for fountain-coded multicast traffic in various network conditions. This suggests that in 802.11a/g WLANs, cross-layer design for multicast rate control may not be beneficial and PHY layer rate control can be done without considering the use of fountain coding at higher layers.
412076	41207665	Proportional Fair Coding for Wireless Mesh Networks	This paper discusses the optimization of multihop wireless networks that carry unicast flows for multiple users. Each flow has a deadline for delay and the wireless links are modeled as binary symmetric channels. Increasing the airtime for one flow decreases the airtime available for other flows sharing the same link. The paper presents a solution for the joint allocation of flow airtimes and coding rates that achieves proportionally fair throughput allocation. This is achieved through a sequence of convex optimization problems, with the final solution providing insight into the nature of the allocation. This is the first time such an analysis has been conducted and one of the first times delay deadlines have been considered in utility fairness.
412076	41207633	Experimental evaluation of multi-path schedulers for LTE/Wi-Fi devices.	LTE technology is being rapidly adopted by network operators to improve network performance. Most mobile devices also have WiFi capabilities, which can be used alongside LTE to further enhance performance. This has led to a growing interest in transmitting data simultaneously over both LTE and WiFi channels. However, designing and evaluating multi-path schedulers for this purpose is difficult because real-world path delays are non-stationary and not well understood. To address this challenge, a new trace-driven approach is proposed in which performance is evaluated using experimental data to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons. This approach has been used to compare the performance of several schedulers.

Compressive Sensing (CS) is a technique that takes advantage of the fact that a sparse signal can be accurately represented with a small number of compressive measurements. This has been proven through theoretical guarantees, showing that sparse signals can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. This paper focuses on a different approach, using manifold models instead of sparse models. By using tools from empirical processes, the authors are able to improve upon previous results and establish bounds for embedding low-dimensional manifolds under random measurement operators. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of manifold-based models for signal recovery and parameter estimation in noisy compressive measurements. Overall, this work supports the idea that manifold-based models can be successfully used in compressive signal processing.
412078	41207842	Random Projections of Smooth Manifolds	The authors propose a new method for reducing the dimensionality of manifold-modeled data using random linear projections. They focus on the effect of these projections on a smooth, well-conditioned K-dimensional submanifold in ℝN. They establish a sufficient number of projections M to preserve pairwise distances between points on the manifold with high probability. This approach is similar to the concept of Compressed Sensing, where sparse signals can be recovered from a small number of random linear measurements. The number of projections M is linear in the information level K and logarithmic in the ambient dimension N, with a logarithmic dependence on the volume and conditioning of the manifold. This method can also reveal important properties about the manifold. It differs from existing techniques in manifold learning, which typically use adaptive, nonlinear mappings from sampled training data.

It works by recovering a high-dimensional signal from a small number of random measurements, assuming the signal has a sparse representation in a known basis. This paper focuses on applying CS to video signals, aiming to reduce the sensing and compression burden in single- and multi-camera imaging systems. By adapting motion compensation and estimation techniques, the authors propose a reconstruction algorithm that alternates between motion estimation and motion-compensated wavelet-domain signal recovery. They demonstrate that their method requires fewer measurements to recover video sequences compared to traditional methods.
412079	41207989	Compressive Sensing for Background Subtraction	Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach for image recovery that allows for using lower sampling rates than traditional methods. It relies on the sparsity of signals in certain bases, such as wavelets, to reconstruct images from a small set of random projections. This paper presents a method for directly recovering background subtracted images using CS, which has applications in communication constrained multi-camera computer vision problems. The proposed method involves casting background subtraction as a sparse approximation problem and using convex optimization and total variation to find solutions. Unlike traditional methods that learn the background, this approach learns a low dimensional compressed representation of it, making it more efficient. The paper also discusses simultaneous appearance recovery of objects using compressive measurements, and provides results on data captured using a compressive single-pixel camera. The proposed method is also shown to be effective for image coding in communication constrained problems, with results from using data captured by multiple conventional cameras for 2D tracking and 3D shape reconstruction.

This allows each pixel to capture light from multiple parts of the scene, and a computational algorithm is used to reconstruct the image. The mask is placed very close to the sensor, making the camera thin. A separable mask is used for easy calibration and image reconstruction. A prototype camera was built using a commercial sensor and mask to showcase the design's potential. Overall, FlatCam offers a unique approach to capturing images with a thin form-factor and efficient processing.
412079	412079114	An Architecture for Compressive Imaging	Compressive sensing is a new approach to processing and reconstructing signals that utilizes a small number of non-adaptive linear projections. This paper presents algorithms and hardware for compressive imaging, using a digital camera that directly captures random projections of an image rather than individual pixels or voxels. The camera uses a digital micromirror array to calculate these projections onto pseudorandom binary patterns. This allows for the acquisition of an image with a single detector, reducing the number of measurements needed and the computational requirements. Additionally, the camera's use of a single photon detector allows for imaging at wavelengths that were previously not possible with traditional CCD and CMOS cameras. A prototype design is being tested and experimental results are included.

The method assumes that the object's vertex positions are determined through range sensing or stereo techniques. The study also examines the effects of quantization errors on the estimation of motion parameters through random sampling and shows that increasing digitalization resolution leads to more accurate results.
412080	41208077	N-Point Hough transform for line detection	The N-point Hough transform is a new method for detecting planar lines in noisy images. It is a generalization of the randomized Hough transform, with the option to set N=2 or N=3 for the randomized and three-point Hough transforms, respectively. The three-point Hough transform is faster and more accurate due to the addition of a third sample point. The N-point Hough transform evaluates the accuracy and robustness of computed lines using (N-2) additional sample points. This is achieved by defining a neighborhood for each line in the voting space and using a metric for clustering bins. Comparisons with the randomized Hough transform show the advantages of the N-point method.
412081	41208118	An Integrated Approach For Simulating Interdependencies	This paper discusses the challenges of simulating interdependent critical infrastructures and proposes a solution through a simulation framework that integrates sector-specific simulators into a general environment. The framework allows for the modeling of individual infrastructures and their internal dynamics, as well as capturing inter-domain relationships and merging information from different simulators. This approach aims to overcome the difficulties of modeling multiple heterogeneous infrastructures and expressing their internal dependencies and interdependencies. Overall, the proposed framework provides a comprehensive simulation of critical infrastructures, addressing the complex and important issue of interdependency.
412081	41208136	A Holistic-Reductionistic Approach For Modeling Interdependencies	Modeling and analyzing critical infrastructures is crucial in identifying potential vulnerabilities and threats. Some approaches take a holistic view and use abstract models, while others focus on specific interactions among components. This paper suggests a combination of both approaches, where critical infrastructures are represented at multiple levels of abstraction and intermediate entities are introduced to provide aggregate resources or services. This mixed approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interdependencies within critical infrastructures.
412081	41208140	Online Distributed Interdependency Estimation For Critical Infrastructures	The paper discusses the challenge of accurately estimating the state of multiple interconnected infrastructures. As interdependencies between infrastructures become more prevalent, it is crucial to have information about the state of others in order to manage any infrastructure effectively, especially in critical situations. However, it is not feasible to have a centralized solution or to exchange detailed data due to the large volumes of information and the need to protect sensitive information. To address this issue, the paper proposes a distributed approach where each infrastructure maintains a copy of the overall model and shares only aggregated and non-sensitive data with other infrastructures. A specific synchronization procedure is also developed to ensure consistent outputs, allowing the system to function as an Online Distributed Interdependency Estimation (ODIE) System. This approach is currently being tested on the electric and telecommunication networks in Europe as part of the MICIE project.
412082	41208215	What groups do, can do, and know they can do: an analysis in normal modal logics	This article discusses various logics that are used to reason about agents' actions, abilities, and knowledge. These logics include Pauly's Coalition Logic CL, Alternating-time Temporal Logic ATL, the logic of 'seeing-to-it-that' (STIT), and their epistemic extensions. The authors introduce a simplification of the STIT language and propose a new semantics for it, as well as extending it to include groups. They also add a temporal operator and standard S5 knowledge operators to this logic, resulting in a new logic called E-X-Ldm G. The authors compare this logic to other epistemic extensions and conclude that it is better suited for expressing agents' abilities and strategies.
412082	41208233	A computationally grounded dynamic logic of agency, with an application to legal actions	The article introduces a new logical framework, called Dynamic Logic of Propositional Control (DL-PC), that allows for the expression of the concept of 'seeing to it that'. This concept, studied by Belnap, Horty, and others, is captured in DL-PC through the use of dynamic operators. The logic also incorporates the Chellas and deliberative stit theories. The satisfiability problem for DL-PC is shown to be decidable. The framework is then extended to DL-PCLeg, which includes operators for normative concepts such as 'legally seeing to it that' and 'illegally seeing to it that'. The decidability result for DL-PC also applies to DL-PCLeg.
412082	4120825	On the dynamics of institutional agreements	This paper introduces the concept of acceptance logic, which models individual and collective acceptances. It uses formulae of the form A_G:xϕ to represent the acceptance of a proposition ϕ by a set of agents G in the context of institution x. The logic is extended by two types of dynamic modal operators: public announcements and acceptance shifting. Public announcements, denoted by x!ψ, inform the agents that ψ is true in context x, limiting the set of possible worlds they accept. Acceptance shifting, denoted by G:x↑ψ, allows agents to change their acceptances and become members of institution x. The resulting logic is shown to have a complete axiomatization and is applied to model judgement aggregation scenarios.

The paper introduces a semi-qualitative approach to uncertainty using the concept of plausibility, in contrast to other analyses which use a quantitative representation of uncertainty through probabilities. The paper includes a complete axiomatization and a proof of decidability for the logic. This framework provides a useful tool for understanding and reasoning about attitudes and decision-making in various contexts.
412083	4120838	A Path in the Jungle of Logics for Multi-agent System: On the Relation between General Game-playing Logics and Seeing-to-it-that Logics.	In recent years, multiple logical systems have been proposed for reasoning about agency and social interaction, as well as representing game properties. This paper aims to organize these various logics by examining the relationship between two specific ones: the dynamic logic of agency (DLA) and the game description language (GDL). DLA, a version of the logic of agency STIT, names agents' actions, while GDL is a formal language for reasoning about general game-playing in AI. The paper presents complexity results for the satisfiability problems of both DLALogic and GDL, and also shows that GDL can be polynomially embedded into DLA.

This paper introduces a new approach to this problem using information theory, which aims to preserve the mutual information contained in the original data while reducing its dimensionality. Unlike previous methods, this approach directly extracts continuous feature functions from the co-occurrence matrix, serving as approximate sufficient statistics for one variable about the other. It can also be seen as a generalized, multi-dimensional, non-linear regression, with the resulting dimension reduction described by two conjugate differential manifolds coupled through Maximum Entropy I-projections. An iterative information projection algorithm is presented and proven to converge, demonstrating its effectiveness in various applications such as text categorization and information retrieval. 
412084	4120848	Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction - A novel Analysis Method	This paper introduces a new information theoretic nonlinear method for dimensionality reduction of co-occurrence data. Unlike previous clustering-based approaches, this method extracts continuous feature functions directly from the co-occurrence matrix, serving as approximate sufficient statistics for one variable about the other. It can be seen as a generalized, multi-dimensional, non-linear regression that unifies aspects of supervised and unsupervised learning. The resulting dimension reduction is described by two conjugate d-dimensional differential manifolds coupled through Maximum Entropy I-projections, with Riemannian metrics determined by the observed expectation values of the extracted features. The paper presents an iterative information projection algorithm for finding these features and proves its convergence. This algorithm is similar to association analysis in statistics, but with a new feature extraction context and information theoretic and geometric interpretation. It is effective in selecting a small set of features and has shown promising results in text categorization and information retrieval.
412084	41208419	Extracting Relevant Structures with Side Information	The problem of extracting relevant information from complex data is often hindered by multiple conflicting structures. The information bottleneck method has been used to address this issue, but it often includes irrelevant information. It is easier to specify what is irrelevant than what is relevant, making it challenging to identify relevant structures. This paper presents a general formulation of this problem and offers a solution that minimizes irrelevant information to improve identification of relevant structures. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in a synthetic example and in text categorization. This method is related to rate distortion theory, with the distortion measure replaced by relevant information, and is formally linked to rate distortion with side information.
412085	41208533	FLUXO: a simple service compiler	In this paper, the authors introduce FLUXO, a system that separates the logical functionality of an Internet service from the architectural decisions made for performance, scalability, and reliability. FLUXO utilizes a dataflow-based programming model, runtime request tracing, and analysis techniques to optimize the service architecture for these factors. The paper presents the authors' vision for simplifying the construction of Internet services and demonstrates how FLUXO can be used to express various performance optimizations. By decoupling the logical functionality from architectural decisions, FLUXO allows for more flexibility and adaptability in designing Internet services.
412085	41208539	CMC: a pragmatic approach to model checking real code	The paper discusses the difficulty of finding system errors that only occur after a specific sequence of events and how model checking can be an effective solution. However, building models for code is often too time-consuming and can lead to missed errors. The paper presents a new model checker, CMC, that directly checks C and C++ implementations, reducing the effort and likelihood of missed errors. This is demonstrated through its successful application to three implementations of the AODV networking protocol, uncovering 34 distinct errors. The paper suggests that this approach could be beneficial for other systems and networking protocols.

The paper also provides examples of CatchAndRetry being used in a large-scale server-side application and a JavaScript client-side application.
412086	412086187	The auction: optimizing banks usage in Non-Uniform Cache Architectures	The rise of wire delay in cache design has led to non-constant access latencies in last-level cache banks. To address this issue, Non-Uniform Cache Architectures (NU-CAs) have been proposed. In chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures, an efficient last-level cache is crucial in reducing requests to off-chip memory due to the speed gap between processor and memory. A bank replacement policy is needed to effectively manage NUCA caches, but the decentralized nature of NUCA has hindered previous policies. A new mechanism called The Auction is proposed, which allows replacement decisions to be spread across the entire cache. This enables global replacement policies, leading to improved performance and reduced energy consumption. Three approaches of The Auction are evaluated and shown to be effective in managing the cache and reducing off-chip memory requests.
412086	41208697	SAMIE-LSQ: set-associative multiple-instruction entry load/store queue	The load/store queue (LSQ) is a complex component in modern processors that has a significant impact on processor performance. The SAMIE-LSQ, a highly banked, set-associative, multiple-instruction entry LSQ, has been developed to improve performance while also reducing energy consumption. This LSQ classifies memory instructions based on the address being accessed and groups instructions accessing the same cache line together. By doing so, it reduces the number of address comparisons needed for memory disambiguation and decreases activity in the data translation lookaside buffer, cache tag, and data arrays. Additionally, the SAMIE-LSQ utilizes caching to save time and energy by reusing translations and avoiding unnecessary checks. Compared to a conventional LSQ, the SAMIE-LSQ has a lower delay and saves a significant amount of energy for the load/store queue, L1 data cache, and data TLB with minimal impact on performance.
412086	412086167	Instruction Scheduling For A Clustered Vliw Processor With A Word-Interleaved Cache	Clustering is a popular method for addressing the delay issue caused by technological advancements. Fully distributed architectures, which divide the register file, functional units, and data cache, are effective and scalable in dealing with these challenges. This paper presents efficient instruction scheduling techniques for a word-interleaved cache clustered VLIW processor. These techniques involve loop unrolling, variable alignment, and different heuristics for assigning memory instructions to clusters. Memory consistency is ensured by restricting memory instruction assignment. The use of Attraction Buffers is also introduced, which replicates data to increase local accesses and reduce stall time. Performance results show a 25% increase in local accesses and a 30% reduction in stall time when using these techniques. Additionally, IPC results are 10% and 5% better compared to a clustered VLIW processor with a centralized/unified data cache. This study was published in 2006 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
412087	41208759	Towards cost-sensitive assessment of intrusion response selection	The concept of cost-sensitive intrusion response has gained attention due to its focus on balancing the potential damage caused by intrusions with the cost of responding to them. However, implementing this approach can be challenging because of the need for consistent and adaptable measurements of cost factors based on system requirements and policies. In this paper, a framework is presented for selecting cost-sensitive intrusion response. This framework includes measurements for potential costs associated with handling intrusions and an evaluation method for response effectiveness, intrusion risk, and cost. An implementation of this framework is also demonstrated using real network traffic. 
412087	41208740	A Cost-Sensitive Model for Preemptive Intrusion Response Systems	The increasing prevalence of complex and fast-spreading cyber attacks has highlighted the need for both improved intrusion detection and advanced automated intrusion response systems. This paper introduces a new cost-sensitive model for intrusion response, which involves deploying response actions preemptively based on cost-benefit analysis. By comparing the cost of deploying a response with the potential damage caused by an unattended intrusion, the model can make informed decisions about when to deploy a response. Additionally, the model can adapt responses to changing environments by evaluating the success and failure of previous responses. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through evaluation using a damage reduction metric.
412087	41208726	XIDR: A Dynamic Framework Utilizing Cross-Layer Intrusion Detection for Effective Response Deployment	The XIDR framework is a comprehensive intrusion detection and response system that utilizes multiple sources to detect and respond to intrusions. It incorporates a cross-layer design, which combines features from different layers of a network to improve detection and reduce false alarms. This approach allows for more precise detection and enables preemptive and adaptive responses to ongoing attacks. By selecting responses from multiple layers, XIDR can effectively mitigate the impact of sophisticated attacks in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
412088	41208810	A comparative analysis of biclustering algorithms for gene expression data.	This article discusses the need for new data mining methods to analyze high-dimensional biological data. Biclustering algorithms have been used to discover local patterns in gene expression data, but it is unclear which algorithms are most effective. The article addresses this issue by comparing 12 recently published or lesser-known algorithms using synthetic data sets and gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus. The algorithms were evaluated based on their performance on different conditions, such as varying noise and number of biclusters. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was also performed on the resulting biclusters. The results suggest that the choice of biclustering method and parameters should be based on the desired model and its ability to handle noise, and that algorithms capable of finding multiple models are more effective in capturing biologically relevant clusters.
412088	41208840	PRASE: PageRank-based Active Subnetwork Extraction	The integration of protein-protein interaction networks and gene expression data has shown promise in identifying significant biomarkers for diseases such as cancer. However, existing algorithms struggle to handle the newer RNA-Seq gene expression data or produce large, difficult-to-analyze subnetworks. To address this issue, a new approach called PRASE has been proposed, which uses the PageRank algorithm and a preprocessing step to prioritize genes that may not be differentially expressed but still play important roles in critical pathways. This workflow has been successfully applied to three cancer datasets, demonstrating its ability to extract more focused and informative subnetworks compared to traditional methods.
412088	41208815	Betweenness centrality on GPUs and heterogeneous architectures.	This article discusses the use of betweenness centrality in graph analyses and its high computational cost. The authors propose several techniques, such as virtualization of high degree vertices, strided access to adjacency lists, and graph ordering, to improve the efficiency of betweenness centrality computations on GPUs and heterogeneous CPU/GPU architectures. They also demonstrate the potential of using both architectures simultaneously to further reduce computation time. Experimental results on social networks show significant improvements, with a 234 million edges graph's computation time reduced from over 4 months to less than 12 days. These techniques can be a valuable tool for reducing the computation time of betweenness centrality in various applications.
412089	41208959	Improving security of virtual machines during live migrations.	Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) is a process that allows a running VM to be transferred to a new hardware component with minimal interruption. This is commonly used in cloud architectures, where users are usually unaware of and unable to prevent live migrations of their VMs. However, if a VM is live migrated to a different data center in another country, it can raise security and privacy concerns. In this paper, the authors propose methods to detect live migrations from within the affected VM and analyze how the migration process can be delayed to allow for security measures to be taken. They have developed a "live migration defence framework" (LMDF) to enforce security policies within a VM. The proposed methods and techniques were evaluated in a cloud setup and partially in the Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2). 
412089	41208930	Data-centric phishing detection based on transparent virtualization technologies	This article introduces a new phishing detection system that uses transparent virtualization technology and isolates its components. It can be added as a security feature for virtual machines in the cloud. The system uses VM introspection to create color-based fingerprints of web pages being viewed in the VM's memory. By comparing these fingerprints, the system can identify and prevent phishing attacks that redirect to fake web pages, as well as "Man-in-the-Browser" attacks.

412089	41208920	Measuring privacy in high dimensional microdata collections	Microdata is collected by companies to improve their services and recommendation systems. This data is often made public after being sanitized, but recent attacks have shown the privacy risks involved. Users currently have to trust the provider to keep their data safe. This study aims to give users more control by creating a tool that measures their privacy and a new privacy metric. The tool uses published popularity statistics and user data to estimate privacy levels, allowing users to decide whether to share their data. It is user-friendly and has been tested on real datasets, showing strong correlations with the actual privacy levels. This tool can accurately estimate privacy levels even without access to the provider's database.
412090	4120904	MRT—a visualization tool addressing problems “outside” the classical rendering domain	We have developed an object-oriented software architecture for a 3D rendering environment that greatly increases productivity for programmers. The platform, called MRT, is made up of customizable building blocks that make 3D image synthesis more accessible. It is based on objects rather than drawings and has been proven to be highly customizable and extendable for a diverse user population. Our partnership with a German mobile communication network supplier resulted in the creation of a prototype package for simulating 3D radio wave distribution in urban environments within just three weeks. This was made possible by the compact and efficient nature of MRT, which also outperformed existing solutions.
412090	41209060	Automatic procedural model generation for 3D object variation	Procedural models are a useful tool for generating variations of 3D objects. They allow for the automatic creation of these variations by changing parameters within the model. However, creating a procedural model can be time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a method for automatically generating a procedural model from a single 3D object. This model consists of a sequence of parameterizable procedures that represent the construction process of the object. By linking the procedural model to the original object surface, changes made to the model can be transferred to the original object, enabling the generation of variations. The user can easily adapt the model by defining variation parameters within the procedures, and we have successfully tested this approach on various object types. 
412090	41209036	Progressive Combined B-Reps - Multi-Resolution Meshes for Interactive Real-Time Shape Design.	The Combined B-rep (cB-rep) is a data structure designed for interactive modeling and visualization of models made up of both curved and flat parts. It utilizes a half-edge data structure and Catmull/Clark subdivision surfaces, allowing for adaptive level-of-detail display and interactive changes to the control mesh using Euler operators. Changes to the mesh are tracked for an undo/redo mechanism, and Euler macros can be used to group operator sequences. The macro dependency graph can then be used for progressively increasing the mesh's resolution and guiding view-dependent refinement. This structure is useful for data visualization, interactive 3D modeling, and as a compact representation for synthetic 3D models.
412091	41209151	Learning discrete categorial grammars from structures	The discrete classical categorial grammars are a class of grammars similar to the reversible class of languages proposed by Angluin and Sakakibara. This class can be identified from positive structured examples using a new algorithm that has a quadratic time complexity. This extends previous work by Kanazawa, as our algorithm can handle multiple types associated with a word and has a polynomial time complexity. We provide linguistic examples to demonstrate the applicability of this class.
412091	41209110	A characterization of alternating log time by first order functional programs	The article discusses the characterization of functions that can be computed in NC1, a class of functions that can be computed in logarithmic time on an Alternating Turing Machine. The characterization is done using first order functional programming languages and involves the use of Sup-interpretations, which help in giving space and time bounds and capturing program schemas. This research is aimed at predicting program resources and is connected to the concept of Quasi-interpretations. It falls under the field of implicit computational complexity.
412091	41209123	Complexity Information Flow in a Multi-threaded Imperative Language	The paper proposes a type system for analyzing the time complexity of multi-threaded imperative programs with a shared global memory. The system identifies a class of safe multi-threaded programs and shows that these programs run in polynomial time if they are strongly terminating with a non-deterministic scheduling policy or terminate with a deterministic and quiet scheduling policy. This also leads to a characterization of polynomial time functions. The type system is based on the concept of data tiering, which controls the flow of information in a computation. This aspect is similar to typed information flow analysis and non-interference. This is the first type system to characterize polynomial time multi-threaded programs.

Overall, this agent allows users to freely ask questions and receive information through various methods, including text, visualizations, and speech.
412092	41209240	Minimally supervised domain-adaptive parse reranking for relation extraction	The paper discusses how a generic parser in a minimally supervised information extraction framework can be customized for relation extraction (RE) in a specific task and domain. The parser used is a deep-linguistic one with a hand-crafted head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) for English. The output is a list of n best parses, ranked by a MaxEnt parse-ranking component trained on a generic HPSG treebank. The paper shows how the confidence of RE rules learned from these parses can be used for parse reranking, resulting in improved RE performance. This method does not require additional annotated data and can be applied with only a semantic seed for the RE task. However, as the best parses for successful rule extraction may not align with those favored by a regular parser evaluation, the overall parsing accuracy may decrease.
412093	41209329	Tight Lower Bounds for st-Connectivity on the NNJAG Model	The directed st-connectivity problem involves determining if there is a path from a specific node s to another node t in a directed graph. A time-space lower bound is proven for the probabilistic NNJAG model, which uses n nodes in the input graph and has a space of S and time of T. The lower bound states that if S is in O(n^(1-delta)), then T is at least 2^(log^2(n/S)); otherwise, T is at least 2^(log^2(nlogn/S)/loglogn) multiplied by the square root of nS/logn. This greatly improves previous lower bounds and is tight when S is in O(n^(1-delta)). As a result, the first tight space lower bound of at least log^2(n) is obtained for the NNJAG model, which was previously unknown.

A new algorithm, BAR, is presented for the case where all requested pages have the same length, which is proven to be 4.56-competitive. This improves upon a previous algorithm which was shown to be 5-competitive. For the case of pages with different lengths, a ( $\Delta+ 2\sqrt{\Delta}+2$ )-competitive algorithm is proposed, improving upon the previous (4Δ+3)-competitive algorithm. A lower bound of 驴(Δ/log驴Δ) is also proven, with better lower bounds for smaller values of Δ. 
412093	4120933	Improved Randomized Online Scheduling of Intervals and Jobs	The article discusses the online preemptive scheduling of intervals and jobs, where the objective is to maximize the total weight of completed tasks. The deterministic case for intervals has been solved, but the randomized case is still unsolved. The paper presents a 2-competitive randomized algorithm for equal length intervals, which is slightly randomized as it initially chooses between two deterministic algorithms and then sticks with one. This algorithm is extended to cover other cases of interval scheduling with the same competitive ratio. A 3-competitive algorithm is also proposed for equal length jobs. The paper concludes with a proof of a lower bound of 2 for the competitive ratio of all barely random algorithms for scheduling equal length intervals. 
412094	41209465	Discovery of Narrativity on the WWW based on Perspective Information Access	The proposed framework aims to discover narrative relationships between objects on the internet by providing perspective information access. While it is easy to access web resources, it can be difficult to find information that meets specific user requests. Most people rely on search engines, but this requires specifying appropriate keywords. The proposed framework is designed for users who are seeking new information related to other information, even if the relationship between them is unknown. It offers a perspective path to guide users to the desired information, creating a narrative between the source and destination. This framework is meant to support users in their search for information.
412094	41209428	Querying with preferences in a digital library	A digital library acts as a mediator between a community of users and federated sources on the Web. The library indexes all available documents and returns URLs of relevant documents when a user submits a query. The size of the answer set, or the number of documents returned, can affect user satisfaction. This paper focuses on the issue of answer sets that are too large and introduces the concept of "personalized queries" which allow users to set an upper limit on the number of documents returned and specify their preferred order. The paper proposes a framework for formally addressing this problem and offers a method for evaluating personalized queries.
412094	41209446	Mediators over Ontology-Based Information Sources	This article proposes a model for integrating and accessing multiple information sources. Each source has an ontology (a set of terms) and a database that stores objects under those terms. The model assumes that all sources have a common underlying domain and may use different ontologies. A mediator, consisting of an ontology and articulations to the sources, is used to integrate the information. Queries are sent to the mediator, which analyzes and translates them into queries for the appropriate sources. The results are then merged to answer the original query. The article discusses the querying and answering process and provides algorithms for the mediator's main tasks, including query translation, source selection, and result merging. 
412095	41209529	A Scenario-View Based Approach to Analyze External Behavior of Web Services for Supporting Mediated Service Interactions	This paper presents a new approach to addressing mismatches in Web service interactions by focusing on both control-flow and data-flow. Current approaches only consider control-flow, but this new approach generates scenarios and views that describe the external behavior of Web services, including data dependencies. A scenario is defined as a set of execution paths for a public process, and a view is generated to analyze this scenario. By describing the external behavior of a Web service as a set of views, this approach is useful for service modelers and users to better understand and resolve behavioral mismatches, ultimately facilitating more effective Web service interactions.
412095	4120958	Better Behavioral Description for Dynamic Semantic Web Services Collaboration	Semantic Web services are designed to automate service operations and minimize human intervention, facilitating seamless interaction between services, reducing operation errors, and maximizing efficiency. While these services are well-described in terms of function, their descriptions of behavior, particularly for complex services, are lacking. This can result in behavioral mismatches between providers and requesters, even when they are functionally compatible. This paper introduces a model for describing the behavior of Web services, including both public and private processes, and emphasizes the significance of public processes in complex interactions. The paper also proposes an approach to enhancing the behavioral description of Web services by building upon existing semantic Web services conceptual models.
412095	41209511	Developing Process Mediator for Web Service Interactions	This paper discusses the importance of web service interactions in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). As web services are autonomous, heterogeneous, and constantly evolving, mediators play a crucial role in supporting service interactions and resolving potential mismatches in business processes. The paper proposes a space-based architecture for process mediators that takes into account both control-flow and data-flow, and provides a framework for automatically mediating mismatch patterns. This approach can be applied at runtime to facilitate smooth service interactions. 
412096	41209615	ATL Transformation for the Generation of SCA Model	The Service Component Architecture specification (SCA) is a technology that supports the development, deployment, and integration of Internet applications. While it can manage dynamic availability and handle differences between components, it cannot solve all problems. As software systems continue to evolve, development and maintenance become more complex. To address this, the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach has been used. This paper focuses on applying MDE automation to convert UML 2.0 models to SCA models. Two metamodels, UML 2.0 component and SCA, are studied and transformation rules are defined in the ATL language to ensure traceability between them. This approach aims to simplify the development process and improve system maintenance.
412096	41209611	MDE approach for the generation and verification of SCA model	SCA is a technology used for developing and integrating internet applications. It helps manage dynamic availability and heterogeneity among components. However, it is not a complete solution for all problems. As software systems become more complex, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is being used to simplify the development and verification process. This paper proposes the use of MDE to create and verify SCA models. Two transformations are applied, one using UML 2.0 metamodel to obtain SCA models and the other using event-B metamodel to verify their properties. The UML 2.0 component metamodel, SCA metamodel and event-B metamodel are studied and transformation rules are defined using the ATL language.
412096	41209628	Semantic Framework for Internet of Things-Aware Business Process Development	The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of connected devices that can communicate with each other and their environment. These devices use standard services and APIs to share information and perform actions, making them key technology enablers for a smarter world. However, there is a lack of formal and clear descriptions for these devices in the context of business processes, making it difficult to model and manage them effectively. To address this issue, a semantic framework is proposed, which includes formalizing IoT resource descriptions, properties, and allocation rules, and resolving conflicts. A proof of concept tool was also developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. 
412097	412097132	Optimizing Tasks Assignment on Heterogeneous Multi-core Real-Time Systems with Minimum Energy	Embedded real-time systems, especially for mobile devices, face the challenge of balancing system performance and energy efficiency. To address this issue, a study was conducted on the relationship between energy consumption, execution time, and completion probability of tasks on heterogeneous multi-core architectures. An Accelerated Search algorithm was proposed, using dynamic programming, to find a combination of task schemes that can be completed within a given time with minimum energy consumption and a desired confidence level. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) was used to represent task dependencies and a Minimum-Energy Model was developed to determine the optimal task assignment. The heterogeneous multi-core architectures can adjust voltage levels with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), resulting in varying execution times and energy consumption. The experimental results showed that this approach outperformed existing algorithms, with a maximum improvement of 24.6%.
412097	412097123	A P2P query algorithm for opportunistic networks utilizing betweenness centrality forwarding	Opportunistic networks, enabled by high-end mobile devices with wireless interfaces, offer promising applications. In these networks, messages are relayed through the mobility of nodes in a store-carry-forward paradigm. However, this relay process faces practical challenges such as delay and delivery rate. To address this, a new P2P Query algorithm called Betweenness Centrality Forwarding PQBCF is proposed. This algorithm uses the Betweenness Centrality BC metric from social networks to measure the active degree of nodes in the network. Nodes with a higher BC are preferred as relays, leading to better query success rate and lower query delay. Comparisons with other algorithms show that PQBCF performs better in terms of query success rate and delay while using fewer resources.
412097	41209746	Energy-aware scheduling on heterogeneous multi-core systems with guaranteed probability.	The biggest challenge for embedded real-time systems, especially on mobile devices, is finding a balance between system performance and energy efficiency. Previous studies have focused on finding an optimal task assignment that minimizes energy while meeting time and architecture constraints. This paper introduces an Accelerated Search (AS) algorithm, using Dynamic Programming (DP), to find a combination of task schemes that can be completed within a given time frame while using the least amount of energy. This is achieved by considering the probability of task completion and energy consumption from data migration. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is used to represent task dependencies, and a Minimum-Energy Model is developed to determine the optimal task assignment. A Minimum Energy Under Probability Constraints (MEUPC) algorithm is then used to assign tasks to cores with appropriate voltage levels to meet probability constraints. A Leaf-Partition (LP) algorithm is used to determine the execution sequence on each core, and a Trading Energy For Time (TEFT) algorithm is proposed to explore parallelism opportunities for further energy reduction. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms other algorithms in the field by up to 30.7%.

Participants from various fields are invited to engage in hands-on activities and discuss strategies for managing personal visibility in relation to design and technology. The focus is on creating speculative design scenarios rather than implementable designs, with the goal of expanding designers' understanding of presence in public spaces beyond the physical to include digital representations. This workshop hopes to stimulate new ideas and perspectives on the intersection of architecture, technology, and personal privacy in public spaces.
412098	41209879	Social gravity: a virtual elastic tether for casual, privacy-preserving pedestrian rendezvous	The authors introduce a virtual "tether" for mobile devices that enables groups to easily and privately meet up.

The authors conduct field trials and compare results with simulations, finding that the system is effective in facilitating social coordination even with unreliable positioning. They also provide design guidelines for similar geosocial interaction systems. The Social Gravity system can be implemented using standard hardware and is shown to be successful in enabling efficient and simple group meetups.
412098	41209846	AudioCanvas: internet-free interactive audio photos	The paper introduces a new interaction technique called AudioCanvas, which aims to make textual information more accessible to those with low or no literacy skills. This technology allows users to use their cameraphones to interact with photos of printed media and receive audio feedback or narration. The design also includes a remote telephone-based service, making it usable without data connections. The effectiveness of the technique was evaluated through user studies in a rural Indian village and a South African township, demonstrating its potential in developing regions. Overall, AudioCanvas shows promise in improving access to information for those with literacy challenges.
412099	41209935	Control and Data Flow Visualization for Parallel Logic Programs on a Multi-window Debugger HyperDEBU	A fine-grained highly parallel program involves multiple threads of execution, making it important to understand the overall execution situation in order to debug it effectively. This is where visualization comes in, and HyperDEBU, a debugger designed for the parallel logic programming language Fleng, helps with this by visually representing the control and data flows of the program based on the user's intention. Breakpoints, which represent the user's intention or perspective, are used by HyperDEBU to visualize the program's execution. This enables efficient debugging through the use of visual examination and manipulation tools.

412099	41209937	Highly Parallel Inference Engine PIE: Goal Rewriting Model and Machine Architecture	Logic programming is a method of processing information that has the potential to handle complex knowledge problems. However, traditional Prolog systems have limited processing power and flexibility when dealing with large problems. To address these issues, a new approach has been developed using Proof Diagrams to represent the natural execution features of logic programs. This approach also includes AND/OR parallel processing based on a goal-rewriting model. The highly parallel inference engine (PIE) is then introduced as an abstract architecture that allows for logic and control to be separated in machine architecture. This design is praised for its high level of parallelism and flexibility when compared to other approaches.

The paper discusses the AOC course and compares the outcomes of students who used P3 with those who did not. It also includes feedback from teachers and students on P3's features. Overall, P3 is a useful tool for teaching and learning about Petri nets in the AOC course.
412100	412100131	Interoperable Petri net models via ontology	The paper introduces a Petri net infrastructure designed for sharing Petri nets on the Semantic Web. Unlike previous solutions that only offer model interchange mechanisms between Petri net tools, this infrastructure includes a Petri net ontology that is closely related to the Petri Net Markup Language (PNML). The ontology was developed using UML and Protege, and is represented using RDF and OWL. The team also created a software tool, P3, which can convert Petri net ontology compliant models to various Petri net tool formats using XSLT. To demonstrate the use of the ontology, the team developed a simple educational web application that utilizes RDF-annotated ontology-based Petri net learning materials. 
412100	41210071	Reusing Petri Nets Through the Semantic Web	The paper introduces a Petri net ontology that allows for the sharing of Petri nets on the Semantic Web. Previous attempts to represent Petri nets through formal methods have been limited to tool-specific descriptions or syntax, making them unsuitable for use on the Semantic Web. This paper uses the Petri net UML model as a basis for developing the ontology, which is then refined using the Protege ontology development tool and the Ontology UML profile. The resulting Petri net models can be represented on the Semantic Web using RDF and OWL. The authors also developed a Petri net software tool and infrastructure for the Petri net Semantic Web.

412101	41210168	Plays as Team Plans for Coordination and Adaptation	Coordinating the actions of a team of robots is a difficult task, particularly in constantly changing environments. In robot soccer, where teams of robots compete against each other, there is a lot of uncertainty in the behavior and abilities of the opposing team. To address this challenge, the concept of a play is introduced as a team plan that combines both reactive and deliberative principles. A playbook is then used to seamlessly merge multiple team plans, allowing for the adaptation of plays in response to unpredictable situations. This approach was successfully implemented in the CMDragons robot soccer team and has shown promising results in dealing with adversarial environments. 
412102	41210290	A Filtering Approach to Stochastic Variational Inference.	SVI is a method that uses stochastic optimization to efficiently compute Bayesian models with large datasets. It can be viewed as an approximate parallel coordinate ascent, balancing bias and variance to approach the optimal solution from batch variational Bayes. A new model is proposed to automate this process by inferring the next optimum from a sequence of noisy observations. This allows the variational parameters to be updated using Bayes rule, rather than a pre-defined schedule. When the model is a Kalman filter, it recovers the original SVI algorithm and can also incorporate additional assumptions such as heavy-tailed noise. In experiments, this method outperforms traditional SVI and other adaptive algorithms in two different domains.
412102	41210269	Black Box Variational Inference.	Variational inference is a popular method for approximating posteriors in complex latent variable models. However, it often requires extensive model-specific analysis, which can hinder the development of new models. In this paper, the authors propose a "black box" variational inference algorithm that can be applied to various models without the need for additional derivations. The algorithm uses stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo sampling to compute a noisy gradient, and various techniques are introduced to reduce its variance. Compared to black box sampling methods, the proposed method achieves better predictive likelihoods in a shorter time. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in exploring a range of models for longitudinal healthcare data.
412102	4121025	Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians	In modern statistics, it is challenging to accurately calculate probability densities. This is particularly important in Bayesian statistics, which uses the posterior density to make inferences about unknown quantities. Variational inference (VI) is a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. It is faster than traditional methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and involves first selecting a family of densities and then finding one that is close to the target density. The closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. VI has many applications, including in exponential family models and Bayesian mixture of Gaussians. There is ongoing research in VI and a need for further understanding and exploration. This article aims to inspire statistical research on VI. 
412103	412103108	Improving accuracy in path delay fault coverage estimation	A new method has been developed to estimate path delay fault coverage by counting newly sensitized path faults in a simulated vector pair. However, this estimate may be pessimistic due to shared paths. To improve accuracy, a range of approximate methods have been proposed, with higher accuracy requiring more CPU time. These methods use flags to indicate if a path segment has already been included in a previously detected fault. A fault is only counted as newly detected if it includes an unflagged segment. This method has a small overhead when there are few fan-in and fan-out branches per gate, and accuracy improves as the length of path segments increases. Results show that this approach provides accurate estimates when using short path segments.
412103	41210317	SIGMA: A simulator for segment delay faults	Lucent Technologies has proposed an efficient technique for simulating combinational circuits using the segment delay fault model. This involves tracing activated segments through a depth-first search and using a segment numbering scheme to determine the number of faults to be simulated. A labeling technique is also used to generate edge labels, allowing for easy access to previously detected segment faults without storing large fault lists. Experimental results have shown the advantages of this model, including manageable numbers of faults for small segment lengths and the potential for increased delay defect coverage through testing of previously overlooked segments.
412103	412103122	STAFAN: An alternative to fault simulation	STAtistical Fault ANalysis (STAFAN) is a new approach to fault simulation for digital circuits. It uses probabilities, estimated from signal statistics, to determine the controllabilities and observabilities of circuit nodes. These probabilities are used to calculate unbiased estimates of fault detection probabilities and overall fault coverage. The method requires only fault-free simulation and has a linearly growing complexity with the number of circuit nodes. It can handle both combinational and sequential circuits. STAFAN is more accurate than random fault sampling and can provide a list of undetected faults. It also takes into account the controllability and observability of each line in the circuit, allowing for a more precise estimation of fault coverage.
412104	41210451	Privacy preserving decision tree learning over multiple parties	Data mining over multiple data sources poses challenges due to legal and competition concerns. Cryptographic methods have been proposed as a solution, but their complexity makes them impractical for large numbers of sources. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for building a decision tree over an arbitrary number of distributed sources while ensuring privacy. The algorithm is based on the ID3 algorithm and allows data sources to run data mining algorithms over the union of their data without revealing any extra information to other sources. This addresses the classification problem and enables data mining in scenarios where multiple sources are involved.
412104	412104239	PRISM: indexing multi-dimensional data in P2P networks using reference vectors	P2P systems research has become increasingly important due to the popularity of file sharing applications. However, these systems often lack efficient search techniques. Existing systems only offer keyword search through a centralized index or query flooding. A new scheme based on reference vectors is proposed to improve multi-dimensional data sharing in P2P systems. This scheme supports a wider range of query operations, such as k-NN queries and content-based similarity search, compared to current systems. The idea is to store multiple replicas of an object's index at different peers based on the distances between the object's features and reference vectors. This allows the system to return accurate results by accessing a small fraction of the participating peers.
412104	412104146	Efficient retrieval for browsing large image databases	Managing large image databases presents a number of challenges, such as organizing and storing data efficiently and developing effective retrieval methods. In image databases, responses to queries are not precise, but rather a set of potential options for the user to choose from. The Alexandria digital library for maps and satellite images uses a browsing model for content-based retrieval, with relevant information encoded as multi-dimensional feature vectors. While previous techniques for reducing the dimensionality of these vectors have been proposed, they may not be effective for exact retrieval in large databases. However, they hold promise as browsing tools for exploring image databases.
412105	4121052	Robust satisfaction of temporal logic over real-valued signals	The article discusses the use of temporal logic formulae to specify constraints on the behavior of continuous and hybrid dynamical systems with uncertain parameters. It introduces different measures of robustness that indicate how close a system's trajectory is to satisfying or violating a property. A method is presented for computing these measures and their sensitivity to system and formula parameters. This approach can aid in verifying nonlinear and hybrid systems against temporal properties through simulation. It can also be applied to identify parameter subsets that guarantee a desired level of robustness in satisfying a formula.
412105	4121057	Symbolic Controller Synthesis for Discrete and Timed Systems	This paper discusses algorithms for creating controllers for discrete and real-time systems. These controllers are synthesized by finding winning strategies for games defined by automata or timed-automata. Since the state-space of these systems grows exponentially with the number of components, traditional methods involve searching through all possible states, which is time-consuming. Symbolic methods, on the other hand, use formulae to represent sets of states, allowing for a more efficient search. While in some cases these methods may be as slow as traditional ones, they are effective for many practical problems. This paper expands the use of symbolic methods to include synthesis and real-time systems.
412105	41210554	From Timed to Hybrid Systems	The proposed framework introduces a new approach for formally specifying and verifying timed and hybrid systems. It includes a specification language for timed systems that uses age functions to measure the duration of time intervals where a given formula remains true. The framework also extends the use of temporal logic, typically used for discrete systems, to hybrid systems which combine discrete and continuous components. This is achieved through a hybrid time semantic model, phase transition systems, and an extended version of Statecharts and temporal logic to accommodate continuous change. This framework can be applied to systems like digital controllers that function in a continuous environment.
412106	41210623	Efficient mining of recurrent rules from a sequence database	This study introduces a new problem of identifying significant recurrent rules from a sequence database. Recurrent rules follow the pattern of "whenever a series of events occurs, eventually another series of events occurs" and are useful in capturing behaviors in various domains, such as software specifications. These rules are an improvement on existing sequential and episode rules as they consider repeated events within and across sequences, and do not have a "window" limitation. The rules are formalized in linear temporal logic and a new concept of rule redundancy is introduced to efficiently mine a representative set of rules. Performance studies and a case study have demonstrated the scalability and usefulness of this approach.
412106	41210627	Mining patterns and rules for software specification discovery	Software specifications play a crucial role in the development of software. However, they are often lacking, incomplete, and outdated in the industry, causing various software engineering problems. These issues can lead to high costs and potential bugs and compatibility issues. To address this, researchers have developed data mining techniques to extract specifications from software engineering data, such as program execution traces. This involves viewing a program trace as a sequence of events and using pattern and rule mining techniques to analyze a set of traces. Studies have shown that this approach is scalable and can successfully recover specifications from real industrial applications. 
412106	4121067	Mining past-time temporal rules from execution traces	Specification mining is a process where specifications are extracted from program execution traces. These specifications can help with program understanding, monitoring, and verification. While there are several tools for dynamic analysis-based specification mining, most only extract future-time temporal expressions. However, past-time temporal rules, which state that a series of events has happened before another series of events, are common and useful in practice. This paper describes an approach to mine these rules from program execution traces, starting with a set of traces and resulting in a set of significant rules that meet certain statistical thresholds. A rule compaction mechanism is also used to reduce the number of reported rules. Experiments on traces of JBoss Application Server demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in inferring meaningful past-time temporal rules. 
412107	41210743	A stepwise optimization algorithm of clustered streaming media servers	Optimizing Clustered Streaming Media Servers (CSMS) is crucial for achieving cost-effective and high-performing systems. This involves balancing performance, quality of service (QoS), and costs. To address this, a stepwise optimization algorithm is proposed, which models the problem as a directed acyclic graph and uses a divide and conquer approach to reduce complexity and speed up the process. A simulation system is also developed based on a theoretical performance model and practical parameters to accurately generate information. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and guide the design of practical CSMS systems. This approach has a significant impact on the practicality and efficiency of CSMS.
412107	4121072	QoS Enhancement for PDES Grid Based on Time Series Prediction	The combination of parallel and distributed discrete event simulation (PDES) with Grid technology is a new trend in simulation. However, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) in this process is challenging. To enhance QoS, a Grid-based framework is proposed that can predict PDES performance based on its unique features like predictable and periodic inputs. Using this framework, a prediction algorithm is developed using time series theory for large scale Grid simulations. Experiments conducted in GridSim demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in improving QoS. This approach has the potential to revolutionize simulation by providing accurate predictions and improving QoS levels.
412107	4121070	A Pipeline Virtual Service Pre-Scheduling Pattern and its Application in Astronomy Data Processing	This paper introduces the concept and formal model of Pipeline Virtual Service (PVS) based on Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). PVS is a type of grid workflow that consists of a group of services executed as a pipeline. The paper describes a PVS Pre-Scheduling Pattern that allows for overlapping the execution time of a PVS with the time of generating and optimizing the scheduling solution pool. This pattern includes two components, the solution generating component (GenFunc) and the solution execution component (ExeFunc), which are supported by two algorithms, SODGen and SODExe. The results of analysis and simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the PVS Pre-Scheduling Pattern in balancing scheduling cost and precision, reducing scheduling and execution time, and selecting optimized solutions. A prototype is also implemented for an astronomy data processing center and early evaluations show the pattern to be feasible, efficient, and flexible in real-world scenarios.
412108	41210832	Computing with semi-algebraic sets represented by triangular decomposition	This article builds upon previous work on triangular decompositions of semi-algebraic systems and introduces new theoretical results that improve these decomposition algorithms. The authors also introduce a technique called "relaxation" which simplifies the decomposition process and reduces the number of redundant components. Additionally, they propose procedures for basic set-theoretical operations on semi-algebraic sets represented by triangular decomposition. Experimentation shows that these techniques are effective. The authors also present new results on the theory of border polynomials of parametric semi-algebraic systems, including a geometric characterization of its "true boundary." These contributions aim to optimize the computation of triangular decompositions and make them more practical for real-world applications.
412108	41210836	Computing with semi-algebraic sets: Relaxation techniques and effective boundaries	This paper focuses on parametric polynomial systems and their applications in real root classification and triangular decomposition of semi-algebraic systems. The authors present new findings in the theory of border polynomials, specifically a definition for the "true boundary" and propose a technique called relaxation to optimize the decomposition algorithms. This technique simplifies the process and reduces the number of components in the output. The paper builds upon previous works by the authors and provides further insights into the use of parametric polynomial systems in solving semi-algebraic problems.
412108	4121088	Triangular decompositions of polynomial systems: from theory to practice	Triangular decompositions are a key tool for solving polynomial systems, providing a convenient way to describe complex solutions and isolate real roots or decompose into irreducible components. They are used in computer algebra systems for systems of algebraic equations and are the main way to determine a symbolic description of solution sets for systems of partial differential equations. The theory of triangular decompositions is based on the concept of characteristic sets, and algorithms using regular chains have been developed to improve efficiency. The implementation of these algorithms is a current focus, with efforts to improve the speed and efficiency of low-level routines.
412109	41210936	Fast Regular Expression Matching Using Small TCAM	This paper introduces a hardware-based approach for regular expression (RE) matching using ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). This is a popular method for packet classification in modern networking devices. The proposed approach uses three techniques - transition sharing, table consolidation, and variable striding - to improve TCAM space utilization and RE matching speed. The effectiveness of these techniques was tested on eight real-world RE sets and the results showed that even small TCAMs can store large deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and achieve high RE matching throughput. For example, a 0.59-Mb TCAM chip can store eight DFAs with 25,000 states each, while a single 2.36-Mb TCAM chip can process multiple characters per transition and achieve a potential RE matching throughput of 10-19 Gb/s for each DFA. 
412109	4121099	Fast regular expression matching using small TCAMs for network intrusion detection and prevention systems	In this paper, the authors propose a new hardware-based approach for regular expression (RE) matching using off-the-shelf Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs). They introduce three techniques, namely transition sharing, table consolidation, and variable striding, to reduce TCAM space and improve RE matching speed. The proposed approach was tested on 8 real-world RE sets and showed potential for high RE matching throughput using small TCAMs. For example, a 0.59Mb TCAM chip was able to store a DFA with 25,000 states using only 12-42 TCAM bits per state. By using a different TCAM encoding scheme, the authors achieved RE matching throughputs of 10-19 Gbps for each DFA with just a single 2.36 Mb TCAM chip.
412109	41210958	Practical methods for constructing suffix trees	The use of sequence datasets is widespread in life science applications, and querying sequences is crucial in these applications. Suffix trees are a useful data structure for evaluating various types of queries on sequence datasets, but constructing them can be time-consuming, particularly for large trees that do not fit in memory. Additionally, the theoretical optimal construction methods for suffix trees do not perform well in terms of processor cache behavior. This paper explores different suffix tree construction algorithms for various data sources and sizes. It is found that a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n2) complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms, and a new algorithm called "Top Down Disk-based" (TDD) is introduced for constructing very large trees. Another new disk-based algorithm based on a sort-merge approach is also shown to be more efficient for constructing large trees with limited resources. 
412110	4121100	Preventing and unifying threats in cyberphysical systems	The topic of CPS security has been widely researched, but only a few studies focus on the general aspects of threats. Most of the existing work is centered on attack detection, which helps to identify threats but does not offer solutions to prevent them. Current system approaches involve detecting and correcting inputs and outputs, but with a large number of inputs and distributed systems, it is important to identify and stop threats at their point of entry. This can be achieved by utilizing a Security Reference Architecture, which has been used to trace attacks but not to stop them. The authors propose using this approach to identify and prevent threats in CPSs, as many of them have similar effects and can be stopped in similar ways. Using threat patterns is seen as a more effective way of describing attacks compared to other models.
412110	41211022	Security patterns and secure systems design	Analysis and design patterns are established methods for building high-quality object-oriented software. These patterns use experience and best practices to create basic models that can be applied to new designs. Security patterns combine the extensive knowledge of security with the structure of patterns to provide guidelines for secure system design and evaluation. Companies such as IBM, Sun, and Microsoft are adopting these patterns. Examples of security patterns include Authentication, Authorization, and Role-based Access Control. They are applied through a secure system development method that considers possible attacks, defines user rights, and implements security policies. These patterns are illustrated using UML models and can be found in the book "Security Patterns" (Wiley 2006). 
412110	412110119	User Group Structures in Object-Oriented Database Authorization	In systems with many users, a large number of authorization rules are needed to define their access rights. This becomes difficult to maintain and inefficient for the system, leading to high memory usage and confusion for security administrators. To address this issue, the solution is to group users together instead of assigning individual access rights. However, previous approaches to grouping users have not been sufficient in describing a wide range of logical groupings. In this paper, a new approach is presented using object-oriented concepts to unify and extend previous methods. This approach can be applied to various data models and operating systems, making it a versatile solution.
412111	41211141	Open Code Coverage Framework: A Framework For Consistent, Flexible And Complete Measurement Of Test Coverage Supporting Multiple Programming Languages	Test coverage is a crucial aspect in determining the effectiveness of software testing. However, current measurement tools for test coverage have various issues, including high costs, inconsistency, and inflexibility. To address these problems, a new measurement framework called the Open Code Coverage Framework (OCCF) has been proposed. This framework supports multiple programming languages and allows for independent addition of language and test coverage criteria support. Additionally, OCCF offers two methods for changing measurement range and elements, making it more flexible. In a sample tool implementation for C, Java, and Python, OCCF was able to measure four test coverage criteria and was also confirmed to support C#, Ruby, Java Script, and Lua. In a comparison experiment with non-framework-based tools, OCCF was able to reduce the required lines of code and time for implementing new test coverage criteria significantly.
412111	41211114	POGen: a test code generator based on template variable coverage in gray-box integration testing for web applications	Web applications are complex and run on various browsers and platforms, making it difficult to conduct proper integration testing. This paper introduces a new test coverage method called template variable coverage, which aims to improve the detection of faults in the connections between subsystems and specific environments. The authors also propose a tool called POGen, which generates skeleton test code with accessor methods to support the template variable coverage criterion. Experiments show that this coverage method is highly effective in detecting faults and that POGen can reduce testing costs. This highlights the importance of establishing efficient integration testing methods and using appropriate tools to ensure the quality of web applications.
412111	41211163	Open Code Coverage Framework: A Consistent and Flexible Framework for Measuring Test Coverage Supporting Multiple Programming Languages	Test coverage is a crucial aspect of software testing, but traditional measurement tools have several issues such as high cost and lack of consistency and flexibility. To address these problems, we propose the Open Code Coverage Framework (OCCF) which can be used for multiple programming languages. OCCF utilizes an abstract syntax tree to identify commonalities among languages and offers guidelines for different test coverage criteria. Additionally, users can easily add their own coverage criteria and new languages. In an experiment, OCCF was found to reduce the amount of code needed for test coverage tools by 90% and the time to implement a special criterion by 80%, compared to conventional tools developed separately.
412112	41211217	Validating Security Design Patterns Application Using Model Testing.	Software developers often lack specialized knowledge in security, which can result in improperly applied security patterns. These patterns, which contain reusable security knowledge, may not effectively mitigate threats and vulnerabilities if applied incorrectly. To address this issue, a new method is proposed for validating the application of security patterns. This method includes extended security patterns, such as requirement- and design-level patterns, as well as a model testing process. Early in the development process, developers specify the threats and vulnerabilities in the system, and the method then assesses whether the security patterns have been properly applied and if the vulnerabilities have been resolved.
412112	41211252	Security patterns: a method for constructing secure and efficient inter-company coordination systems	The increasing use of the Internet, intranets, and other large networks has led to a rise in interest for mobile agents as a way to build distributed systems. However, ensuring security while also maintaining efficient implementation has been a challenge. In this paper, the authors propose a method that addresses this issue and demonstrate its application in a real-world system. The approach involves using patterns, which are templates for system behavior, to specify different options that meet the security requirements. These patterns include agent migrations, communication between applications, and security procedures. By modeling the performance data associated with each pattern, developers can select the most efficient implementation for their system. The authors show the effectiveness of their approach through the Environmentally Conscious Product (ECP) design support system, which requires coordination among multiple companies.
412112	41211259	TESEM: A Tool for Verifying Security Design Pattern Applications by Model Testing	Software developers may not have the expertise to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities during the early stages of development. Even if these issues are addressed at this stage, it does not guarantee that the final product will meet security requirements. To address this, extended security patterns are proposed, including requirement and design-level patterns, and a new model testing process. This approach is supported by the TESEM tool, which automatically executes model testing based on specified threats and vulnerabilities. This allows developers to verify the proper application of security patterns and assess the resolution of vulnerabilities during the early stages of development.
412113	41211313	The impacts of personal characteristic on educational effectiveness in controlled-project based learning on software intensive systems development	This study examines the impact of team composition and learning process on educational effectiveness in software-intensive business systems courses. The lack of an established method to determine optimal team composition prompted the use of the Five Factors and Stress theory and modified grounded theory approach to measure personal characteristics and identify the learning process of team members. The study found that having team members with different personal characteristics leads to increased knowledge and skills acquisition. Moreover, teams that focus on a smaller number of learning process topics also demonstrate higher educational effectiveness. These findings have implications for improving educational effectiveness in similar practical courses.
412113	41211372	Using an Automatic Collection Method to Identify Patterns during Design Activity	Design is a crucial aspect of software development, but it is subjective and varies based on the designer's knowledge and skills. The design process can be modeled as a sequence of "Create", "Delete", and "Modify" actions on a UML class diagram. To better understand design strategies, an automatic approach was proposed to collect information about the process. The strategies considered were top-down, bottom-up, breadth-first, depth-first, and opportunistic. By analyzing frequent patterns and the position of actions in the sequence, two types of relationships were identified: micro-patterns and macro-patterns. Case studies were conducted to evaluate the approach, revealing that there is no universal design strategy, but rather a combination of strategies used by designers. 
412113	41211326	Automatic Extraction and Verification of Page Transitions in aWeb Application	 The demand for reliable Web applications has risen due to their increased use in enterprise applications. Model checking is an effective method to improve software reliability, but its implementation in the fast-paced development of Web applications can be challenging due to high preparation and application costs. A solution is proposed in this paper, which involves automatically extracting page transitions from a Web application developed with a framework like Struts and Java Server Page templates and converting it into a format compatible with existing model-checking tools. This technique aims to reduce the costs associated with incorporating model-checking techniques in Web application development.
412114	41211480	Towards a semantic model for Java wildcards	Java wildcards are a way to express more types in Java and expand the range of programs that can be typed. While previous research has focused on syntactic models and proofs for type systems related to Java wildcards, there has been little study on the semantics of wildcards. This paper presents a semantic model for Java wildcards based on semantic subtyping, which interprets types as sets of possible values. The model is defined in terms of runtime types, rather than the structure of runtime values, to reflect the nominal type system of Java. The model also accounts for variance introduced by wildcards and shows the soundness of syntactic subtyping. However, completeness is not guaranteed in the general case, but a restricted type language is identified for which syntactic subtyping is both sound and complete. 
412114	41211436	Reversible sessions with flexible choices	The authors propose a new calculus for concurrent reversible multiparty sessions that includes a flexible choice operator inspired by the concept of connecting action. This operator allows for different sets of participants in each branch, making it suitable for describing communication protocols with optional participants. The calculus also supports a compact representation of process history and types, facilitating the definition of rollback and implementing a strategy for backward computation. A session type system is also presented, demonstrating that the calculus enforces session fidelity, forward progress, and backward progress. 
412114	41211445	Encoding CDuce in the Cpi-Calculus	CDuce is a functional programming language that uses overloaded functions and a rich type system with various types such as recursive, subtyping, union, negation, and intersection types. Its boolean constructors have a set-theoretic behavior based on the interpretation of types. The Cπ-calculus, an extension of the π-calculus, also uses set-theoretic interpretation and adds union, intersection, and negation types to its subtyping system. This work presents a faithful encoding of CDuce into Cπ-calculus, which was a challenge due to the need to preserve the subtyping relation. This encoding provides insight into the Milner-Turner encoding and the relationship between sequential and remote execution of functions. It also confirms the validity of equational laws for union and intersection types in π-calculus. 
412115	41211575	Lazy Bayesian Rules: A Lazy Semi-Naive Bayesian Learning Technique Competitive to Boosting Decision Trees	LBR is a learning technique that aims to improve the performance of naive Bayesian classifiers by addressing the issue of attribute interdependence. It does this by creating a conjunctive rule and using a subset of training examples to induce a local naive Bayesian classifier for classifying a test example. This approach has been found to be effective in reducing the bias and variance of the naive Bayesian classifier, resulting in improved performance. LBR is a useful tool for dealing with the limitations of naive Bayesian classification and can lead to better classification results. 
412115	41211567	Selective Augmented Bayesian Network Classifiers Based on Rough Set Theory	The naive Bayes classifier is a popular tool in interactive applications due to its efficiency and theoretical base. However, its assumption of attribute independence can lead to lower accuracy. To improve this, various techniques have been developed to relax this assumption. One such technique is TAN, which incorporates limited forms of inter-dependence between attributes. Another approach is using rough sets theory, which allows for inexact or partial dependencies within a dataset. In this paper, a variant of TAN using rough sets theory is proposed and compared to other TAN-based classifiers. The new approach shows improved accuracy and requires less computation than previous methods. It is a selective restricted trees Bayesian classifier.
412115	41211571	Adjusting Dependence Relations for Semi-Lazy TAN Classifiers	The naive Bayesian classifier is a popular method for classification, but it assumes a Bayesian network where each attribute only has one parent, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) is an extension that allows for partial dependence among attributes. This paper analyzes two TAN implementations and their tree structures, showing the impact of different dependence relations on accuracy. The authors propose a semi-lazy TAN classifier that adjusts the dependence relations for a new test instance, resulting in lower error rates and greater efficiency compared to the original TAN and Superparent TAN. This highlights the importance of considering dependence relations in classification tasks. 
412116	41211619	Contractible subgraphs in 3-connected graphs	The article discusses a conjecture by McCuaig and Ota regarding the existence of a contractible subgraph in 3-connected graphs. A subgraph H of a 3-connected graph G is considered contractible if H is connected and G with H removed is still 2-connected. The conjecture states that for any value of k, there exists a function f(k) such that any 3-connected graph with at least f(k) vertices will have a contractible subgraph with k vertices. The article presents a proof of this conjecture for k ⩽4 and explores its implications in various types of graphs, such as maximal planar graphs, Halin graphs, and AT-free graphs.
412116	41211622	On the number of contractible triples in 3-connected graphs	McCuaig and Ota's research demonstrated that any 3-connected graph with at least 9 vertices contains a contractible triple, meaning a connected subgraph of three vertices where the remaining graph is still 2-connected. This study goes further to show that such graphs have at least one tenth of the total number of vertices as contractible triples. Additionally, if the graph is cubic, meaning each vertex has exactly three edges, then there will be at least one third of the total number of vertices as contractible triples, which is the maximum possible.
412116	4121164	Nonseparating K-4-subdivisions in graphs of minimum degree at least 4	The article discusses the proof that every 4-connected graph contains a subgraph isomorphic to a subdivision of the complete graph K-4, answering a question posed by Kuhnel. This proof relies on a result by Fontet and Martinov which states that a 4-connected graph can be reduced to a smaller graph by contracting a single edge, unless it is a square of a cycle or a line graph of a cubic graph. The proof is then generalized to connected graphs with minimum degree 4 by developing a structure theorem for this class of graphs. This theorem states that a connected graph with minimum degree 4 cannot be reduced to a smaller graph by deleting or contracting a single edge, unless it is a specific type of brick graph. These brick graphs include K-3, K-5, K-2,K-2,K-2, K-5(-), K-2,2,2(-), K-5(del), K-2,2,2(del), K-5((sic)), and K-2,2,2((sic)). This proof shows that 4-connectedness is the only important factor in the existence of a subgraph isomorphic to K-4.
412117	41211755	A context management infrastructure with language integration support	Context-management systems have been developed to support context-aware applications. These systems usually have APIs and query languages for analyzing context. However, they do not have effective support for reacting to context changes within the constraints of the framework. In this paper, a new context-management system is presented that combines context reasoning with context-dependent behavior using dynamic adaptation techniques like aspect- and context-oriented programming. The system offers various levels of integration with programming language extensions and allows for dynamic aggregation of local and distributed context sources. A query library for the JCop language has been implemented as a first step, and an example application is demonstrated to showcase its capabilities.
412117	41211736	Efficient layer activation for switching context-dependent behavior	The paper introduces the concept of Context-oriented Programming, which aims to provide programming language extensions that allow programs to dynamically adapt to their execution context. This is achieved by dividing programs into layers that can be activated or deactivated based on the context, and can be composed in any order. The implementation of this model is efficient, with a dynamic representation of layers that shows competitive performance in both activation/deactivation and overall program execution. The paper also provides an example of how this approach can be used in place of aspect-oriented programming. Overall, Context-oriented Programming offers a flexible and efficient way to modify program behavior at runtime.
412117	41211738	SqueakJS: a modern and practical smalltalk that runs in any browser	SqueakJS is a JavaScript-based implementation of Squeak/Smalltalk that can run in a web browser. It has a virtual filesystem that can be connected to a server or client-side storage. The implementation is known for its simplicity and performance, achieved through adapting to the host object memory and utilizing the Lively Web development environment. The authors share their techniques and performance measurements for the resulting virtual machine. This experience can be useful for preserving other dynamic language systems and making them accessible in a browser setting.
412118	41211841	Another Look at Complementation Properties	This paper discusses a variety of attacks based on the complementation property of DES. The authors use symmetry relations in the key schedule and rounds to create distinguishers for any number of rounds, leading to a generalization of the complementation property. They also explore the use of fixed points in these relations to develop new types of attacks. The paper presents a self-similarity property in the SHA-3 candidate Lesamnta, which reveals unexpected weaknesses in its compression function. The authors demonstrate how this property can be used to find collisions much faster than generic attacks. Additionally, a related-key differential attack on round-reduced versions of the XTEA block-cipher is proposed, exploiting weaknesses in the key-schedule to recover the secret key more efficiently. The authors also identify a class of weak keys that can be used to attack a large number of rounds in the cipher.
412118	41211839	Synthesis of Fault Attacks on Cryptographic Implementations	Fault attacks refer to a type of attack where an adversary physically manipulates a cryptographic device, such as a smartcard, in order to extract secret information. These attacks have been a focus of research since the first successful attack on modular exponentiation. With an increasing focus on concrete implementations, finding new fault attacks has become more difficult. To address this, a new approach has been proposed that uses mathematical properties, known as fault conditions, to systematically analyze the security of cryptographic implementations. By identifying these fault conditions, it is possible to automatically discover new attacks. This approach has been successfully applied to find multiple fault attacks on RSA and ECDSA, some of which are new and of independent interest. 
412118	41211852	Leakage-Resilient Symmetric Encryption via Re-keying.	The paper explores the possibility of constructing a leakage-resilient symmetric scheme using the AES block cipher. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical schemes that lack security proof against side-channel adversaries. The proposed method involves adding a leakage-resilient re-keying scheme on top of the encryption scheme, which has been shown to prevent differential power analysis techniques. This method is also heuristically secure against single-point attacks. The paper proves that using a leakage-resilient re-keying scheme with a secure encryption scheme results in a leakage-resilient encryption scheme. The paper also discusses the two different techniques for re-keying and suggests using the sequential method, although it may require more computations in case of de-synchronization.
412119	41211973	A Logic Programming Approach to Scientific Workflow Provenance Querying	Scientific workflows are essential for facilitating and expediting scientific discoveries. These workflows integrate and organize diverse data and services for conducting virtual experiments. To ensure the reproducibility and validation of scientific results, the management and querying of provenance information has become crucial. This paper presents a logic programming approach, FLOQ, for querying and managing scientific workflow provenance. The authors identify important characteristics for a provenance query language and demonstrate how FLOQ meets these requirements. They also show how their previous model, virtual data schema, can be easily translated into FLOQ. The paper includes examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of FLOQ, including solving the provenance challenge queries. 
412119	4121197	Scalable Provenance Storage and Querying Using Pig Latin for Big Data Workflows	Provenance is information about the origin and history of a data product, which is crucial for assessing its quality and reliability. In the context of data-centric scientific workflows, much research has been done on storing and querying provenance. However, with the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of big data, a new generation of workflows called big data workflows are being developed. This has led to the need for a scalable storage and querying system for big data workflows. This paper proposes a system that leverages Pig Latin and OPQL to translate provenance queries and support the W3C PROV-DM standard. The system is evaluated on provenance datasets and has potential for efficient storage and querying of big data workflows.
412119	41211966	RDFProv: A relational RDF store for querying and managing scientific workflow provenance	Provenance metadata is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility and interpretability of scientific discoveries, as well as diagnosing problems in scientific workflows. The provenance management problem focuses on effectively modeling, recording, representing, integrating, storing, and querying this metadata. This paper presents RDFProv, a relational RDF store designed to efficiently manage and query provenance metadata in scientific workflows. The system integrates Semantic Web technologies with an RDBMS and includes algorithms for mapping an OWL provenance ontology to a relational schema, mapping RDF metadata to relational data, and translating SPARQL queries to SQL. Experimental results show improved performance and scalability compared to other popular RDF stores. A case study in a biological simulation workflow demonstrates the effectiveness of RDFProv. These techniques can also be applied to managing general RDF data.
412120	41212059	CiNCT: Compression and retrieval for massive vehicular trajectories via relative movement labeling.	This paper introduces a compressed data structure for representing moving object trajectories in a road network. Unlike existing methods, this structure supports pattern matching and decompression from any position while maintaining high compression rates. It is based on the FM-index, a data structure known for its fast and compact pattern matching abilities. To further improve compression, the authors incorporate the sparsity of road networks and introduce the concepts of relative movement labeling and PseudoRank. Experimental results show that their method outperforms existing trajectory compression methods and FM-index variants in terms of data size and query processing time.
412120	41212048	Efficient error-tolerant query autocompletion	This paper discusses the problem of query autocompletion with error tolerance, where users' input may contain errors. Previous approaches use a trie data structure to index data strings and maintain prefixes within a certain edit distance from the query. However, this method becomes inefficient for short queries and large alphabets. The paper proposes a new algorithm, IncNGTrie, which significantly improves the speed of autocompletion by only maintaining a small set of active nodes. The paper also addresses the issue of efficient duplicate removal and suggests optimization techniques to reduce the index size. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
412120	41212053	A Dynamic Mobility Histogram Construction Method Based on Markov Chains	The advancement of spatial information and communication technologies has made it easier to track the movements of many objects in real-time. Mobility statistics are crucial for analyzing and predicting movement patterns. To address this, a mobility histogram based on the Markov chain model is proposed to summarize multiple object trajectories. A data cube-like logical representation is provided for interactive analysis and a tree structure is used for efficient construction and maintenance of the histogram. This is important as trajectory data is often received continuously. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
412121	41212136	Managing Process Model Complexity Via Abstract Syntax Modifications.	The use of Business Process Management (BPM) technology has become increasingly popular, requiring stakeholders to understand and agree upon the process models used in BPM systems. However, users often struggle with the complexity of these models. The main challenge is to enhance the understanding of process models, and there is a significant amount of literature devoted to this topic.
412121	41212138	Business process variability modeling : A survey	Organizations often have multiple versions of a business process, but traditional process modeling languages do not explicitly support representing these variants. This has led to a significant amount of research in the past decade, resulting in various approaches to business process variability modeling. These approaches add specialized features to conventional process modeling languages to capture customizable process models. A customizable process model can represent a family of process variants, with each variant being derived by adding or deleting fragments based on customization or domain options. This survey provides a systematic overview of these modeling approaches, comparing them and identifying common and unique features. It also highlights the abundance of customizable process-modeling languages, but a lack of tool support and empirical evaluations. 
412121	41212155	APROMORE: An advanced process model repository	Business process models are widely used in various industrial applications, resulting in a large number of models being available. However, this poses a challenge in terms of proper management and ensuring that the correct model is always accessible to stakeholders. On the other hand, having a large set of process models also presents opportunities for re-using certain parts for new models. In this paper, the authors introduce APROMORE, an advanced process model repository that offers features for analyzing, managing, and using large sets of process models. The paper presents the tool's functionality, architecture, and a prototype, demonstrating its feasibility. The authors also discuss potential future developments for APROMORE.
412122	41212227	Achieving side-channel protection with dynamic logic reconfiguration on modern FPGAs	Reconfigurability is a key feature of modern FPGA devices, allowing for different hardware circuits to be loaded on demand. This makes it difficult for attackers to predict what will happen at a specific location in the FPGA. The authors present a hardware implementation of the PRESENT cipher with built-in side-channel countermeasures using dynamic logic reconfiguration. Their design utilizes Configurable Look-Up Tables (CFGLUT) in Xilinx FPGAs to quickly change the hardware internals of the cipher, improving resistance against side-channel attacks. Experimental results on a Spartan-6 platform show that even with 10 million recorded power traces, the first-order leakage cannot be detected with state-of-the-art methods.
412122	41212248	ParTI: Towards Combined Hardware Countermeasures against Side-Channeland Fault-Injection Attacks	Side-channel analysis and fault-injection attacks pose significant threats to cryptographic implementations, making it crucial to implement appropriate countermeasures before deployment. However, these countermeasures differ in nature - side-channel attacks require techniques to hide key-dependent information, while fault-injection attacks can be countered with redundancy in computation for error detection. Implementing a single countermeasure already incurs costs in performance and area, and combining multiple countermeasures is expensive and can have unwanted side effects. This study introduces a countermeasure that combines a provably-secure masking scheme with an error detection approach for cryptographic hardware implementations, using the lightweight LED cipher as a case study. The implementation achieves first-order resistance against side-channel attacks and superior fault detection compared to simple duplication, with an added area demand of 12%.
412122	4121224	Implementing Curve25519 for Side-Channel-Protected Elliptic Curve Cryptography.	ECC is a popular cryptographic system for secure embedded applications, but it requires complex modular arithmetic that can be challenging for small processors. To address this issue, Bernstein proposed Curve25519, which offers high efficiency and resistance to power and timing attacks. This study demonstrates that Curve25519 is also effective on FPGA devices, with a maximum performance of over 32,000 point multiplications per second. Even with side-channel countermeasures to prevent power analysis, the performance remains high at over 27,500 point multiplications per second with a moderate increase in logic resources. This makes Curve25519 a competitive option for secure embedded applications on both software and hardware platforms.

The study analyzes YouTube access patterns and demonstrates the impact of the ASSIST architecture on user behavior in this domain. 
412123	4121232	Interaction-Based Recommendations for Online Communities	The challenge of keeping online communities active is addressed through personalization and recommendation technologies. In communities focused on behavioral change, the main motivation for participation is to connect with like-minded individuals rather than real-world friends. However, traditional approaches to personalization rely on friendship relations, which are not present in these communities. To address this, a social behavior model is proposed, which looks at interactions between members and resources. This model is applied to two types of recommendation systems and is tested on a 12-week program for diet and lifestyle in an online community. The results show that the social behavior-based algorithms outperform other methods.
412124	41212498	Set similarity join on massive probabilistic data using MapReduce	This paper discusses the challenge of efficiently performing set similarity join on large probabilistic datasets using the MapReduce paradigm. The authors propose two approaches, Hadoop Join by Map Side Pruning and Hadoop Join by Reduce Side Pruning, which use different methods to filter out candidate pairs and reduce the comparison cost. They also present a hybrid solution that combines both approaches. Experiments on Hadoop-0.20.2 show that these approaches outperform the naive method of Block Nested Loop Join and have good scalability. This is the first work to address this problem using MapReduce and provides a new method for processing massive probabilistic data.
412124	41212478	Efficient query processing for XML keyword queries based on the IDList index	Keyword search in XML data has been a popular research topic in recent years, with focus on efficiently answering queries based on specific semantics. Existing methods have been hindered by the common-ancestor-repetition problem. In this paper, the authors introduce a new inverted list called IDList, which contains ordered nodes that directly or indirectly contain a given keyword.

412124	41212425	Related Axis: The Extension to XPath Towards Effective XML Search	The limitations of current XML search methods are explored and a new approach, called "related relationship," is proposed to better capture meaningful connections between data elements in XML data. An extension to XPath, called the "related axis," is also introduced to increase the flexibility of querying. To reduce the cost of computing related relationships, a new schema summary is suggested. This summary is used to create two indices, improving the performance of query processing. The proposed algorithm shows that most queries can be simplified into selection and value join operations, avoiding costly structural join operations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method compared to existing keyword search semantics and query engines.
412125	41212538	An abstract formalization of correct schemas for program synthesis	This paper discusses the importance of incorporating both structured program design principles and domain knowledge into program schemas for hierarchical program synthesis. While most current approaches only focus on the syntactic aspect of schemas, this paper proposes a semantic approach that includes a formalized template and a first-order axiomatization of the problem domain. This framework allows for a formal definition of correctness and enables the use of correct schemas to guide program synthesis. By incorporating both syntactic and semantic elements, this approach aims to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of program synthesis.
412125	41212523	Correct-schema-guided synthesis of steadfast programs	Program schemas play a crucial role in (semi-)automated software development as they capture both structured program design principles and domain knowledge. While most researchers represent schemas using purely syntactic methods, we propose a semantic approach by formalizing schemas as open logical theories with open logic programs. By using a concept called steadfastness, we can define and reason about the correctness of schemas and use them to synthesize correct programs. This allows for a more thorough and comprehensive representation of the knowledge captured by schemas, making them indispensable for hierarchical program synthesis.
412125	41212561	The relationship between logic programs and specifications-the subset example revisited	This article discusses the fundamental relationship between a program and its specification, which is based on the concept of correctness. In logic programming, this relationship is especially close as both specifications and programs can be expressed using logic. The authors argue that this relationship should be considered in the context of the problem domain, referred to as a framework, and provide a model-theoretic perspective on the correctness relation between specifications and programs within a framework. They demonstrate that this relation is always well-defined and highlight the importance of properly distinguishing between a program and its specification. The article uses a subset example to illustrate their approach.
412126	41212690	Provably secure authenticated key agreement scheme for distributed mobile cloud computing services.	Mobile cloud computing has become increasingly popular, but this also brings concerns about security in distributed environments. In 2015, Tsai and Lo proposed a privacy-aware authentication scheme for these services, but it was found to be vulnerable to server impersonation and leaks of sensitive information. To address these issues, a new authentication scheme with stronger security features was proposed. It was rigorously analyzed and found to be secure against various attacks. The scheme also has lower computational costs for mobile users and was evaluated using a network simulator. This new scheme is considered more suitable for practical applications compared to the previous one proposed by Tsai and Lo.

RFID technology is widely used for automatic identification and has become a core technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). To ensure security and privacy, RFID authentication is essential. However, many existing RFID authentication protocols have security weaknesses and inefficient performance. In this paper, the authors review Kaur et al.'s protocol and identify its security deficiencies. They propose a new lightweight anonymous authentication protocol for RFID systems using elliptic curve cryptography, which has been shown to achieve mutual authentication, confidentiality, anonymity, and resistance to various attacks. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol reduces computation and communication costs significantly compared to previous protocols.
412126	41212656	Efficient and short certificateless signatures secure against realistic adversaries	Certificateless cryptography aims to eliminate the use of certificates in traditional public key cryptography and solve the key-escrow problem in identity-based cryptography. Various security models have been developed and new schemes have been introduced based on these models. Stronger security models provide a higher level of security, while more realistic models lead to more efficient schemes. This paper introduces an efficient certificateless signature scheme with a short signature size, based on a realistic security model. The scheme is as efficient as the BLS short signature scheme and provides a rigorous security proof in the random oracle model. It is based on the k-CAA hard problem and a new, more efficient problem called the modified k-CAA problem. This scheme is particularly useful for systems with human input or limited bandwidth and computation power.
412127	41212745	Exploring the Design Space of AAC Awareness Displays.	Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices are crucial for individuals with speech disabilities. However, one challenge with these devices is their inability to convey nonverbal communication cues that usually complement or substitute for verbal speech. This paper explores the design of awareness displays that can supplement AAC devices, considering their impact on how the users are perceived by others. The design process involved creating prototypes and receiving feedback from people with ALS, their caregivers, and communication partners. The study found a tension between abstractness and clarity in the designs and also raised concerns about how these displays may further label individuals using AAC as "different." Overall, this research provides insights into the design of AAC awareness displays to enhance communication for individuals with disabilities.
412127	41212777	AACrobat: Using Mobile Devices to Lower Communication Barriers and Provide Autonomy with Gaze-Based AAC.	Gaze-based alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices allow people with neuromuscular diseases to communicate through eye movements. However, these devices have slow input, leading to communication breakdowns and decreased autonomy, quality, and engagement for users and their conversation partners. Previous attempts to improve these devices have focused on increasing input speed, but with limited success. This work approaches the issue from a different angle, viewing AAC devices as groupware and designing interactions that facilitate better conversations for all involved. Through qualitative research and user preferences, design guidelines were identified and incorporated into AACrobat, a system that includes a mobile companion app. Early feedback from three case studies with users with ALS suggests that AACrobat improves communication and user satisfaction.

While TTS systems have advanced to include a range of emotions, AAC systems have not yet incorporated this feature, resulting in speech that lacks expressivity. The authors introduce the concept of "voicesetting," which involves authoring the speech properties of text, and present two user interfaces for this purpose: the Expressive Keyboard and the Voicesetting Editor. The interfaces were evaluated for output quality, effort required, and usability, and were highly valued by end-users for improving communication quality. Design insights from the evaluations are also discussed.
412128	41212862	Vehicle Orientation Analysis Using Eigen Color, Edge Map, And Normalized Cut Clustering	The paper introduces a new method for estimating the orientation of vehicles in still images. This is achieved through a clustering framework that utilizes eigen color and edge mapping. A novel color transform model is used to segment vehicles from their background, which is invariant to changes in contrast, background, and lighting. However, this model alone cannot accurately extract the shape of the vehicle, so the distributions of edges and colors are combined to form a high-dimensional feature space. This is then reduced using normalized cut spectral clustering, which minimizes dissimilarity between groups. The orientation can be determined by analyzing the eigenvectors. Unlike traditional methods, this approach only requires one still image and has shown promising results in experiments.
412128	41212819	Vehicle Retrieval Using Eigen Color and Multiple Instance Learning	The paper presents a new method for retrieving images of vehicles from databases using eigen color and multiple instance learning. Traditional methods face challenges in accurately describing vehicles due to variations in color and shape under different conditions. The proposed approach uses a color transform model to extract regions of interest from databases and the MIL method to learn specific visual properties from query images. An eigen color transform is introduced to improve accuracy and adaptability, and experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach. This method does not involve time-consuming optimization and can quickly obtain desired visual concepts for different user requests. 
412128	41212811	Automatic traffic surveillance system for vehicle tracking and classification	This paper introduces an automatic traffic surveillance system that uses one camera to estimate traffic parameters from video sequences. The proposed method has the ability to classify vehicles into specific classes by introducing a new "linearity" feature and can handle vehicle occlusions caused by shadows. A novel line-based shadow algorithm is used to eliminate unwanted shadows, and a scheme to detect lane-dividing lines is also proposed. These lines provide important information for feature normalization and enhance the accuracy of vehicle classification. An optimal classifier is designed to categorize vehicles into different classes, using evidence from trajectories and a database. Experimental results show that this method is more accurate and robust than traditional methods.
412129	41212948	Ten Blue Links on Mars.	In this paper, the authors discuss the challenge of providing a high-quality search experience on Mars, where the speed-of-light propagation delays result in significant latency. They explore the feasibility of overcoming this challenge and providing a tolerable user experience by considering the tradeoff between waiting for responses from Earth and pre-fetching or caching data on Mars. The authors present two case studies that use publicly available data to demonstrate the effectiveness of baseline techniques. They argue that this research problem is not only relevant for potential Mars colonization, but also for Earth-based scenarios with similar constraints, such as searching from rural villages in India. 
412129	41212921	Evaluating Streams of Evolving News Events	People tend to track news events based on their level of interest and available time. For major events they are highly interested in, they may check for updates multiple times an hour and stay updated on all aspects. However, for minor events that are less interesting, they may only check once or twice a day for a few minutes to stay informed. In order to improve user performance and avoid information overload, systems that provide updates on evolving events should appropriately filter the updates. However, predicting user performance on these systems can be challenging. The standard evaluation methodology used for Web search and other retrieval tasks may not be suitable for this context. In this paper, a simple model is developed to simulate user behavior of checking the system for updates. This model is tested using data from the TREC 2013 Temporal Summarization Track, and it is found that the primary measure used in this track closely corresponds to a user who checks the system once a day for an average of one minute. However, users who check more frequently and for longer periods of time may have a different perception of the system's performance. Therefore, it is recommended that future experiments clearly state assumptions about user behavior and use effectiveness measures that reflect these assumptions.
412129	41212953	Impact of query intent and search context on clickthrough behavior in sponsored search.	This article discusses the use of implicit feedback techniques to detect query intent in sponsored search. The authors propose a methodology that combines the content of search engine result pages (SERPs) and query strings to understand user behavior and interests, particularly in online commercial intent. They also introduce a model for clickthrough behavior that considers factors such as ad location, rank, and query category, and evaluate this model using a large dataset from a commercial search engine. The results suggest that query-based features and SERP content are effective in detecting intent, and that context-related factors have a significant impact on clickthrough rate. The authors recommend considering these factors when evaluating ad performance.

The paper also describes the hardware and software components of the system, along with five demonstration applications showcasing its capabilities. 
412130	41213018	Designing to support prescribed home exercises: understanding the needs of physiotherapy patients.	Musculoskeletal disorders are a major health issue globally, affecting millions of people. Physiotherapy, which includes prescribed exercises for patients to do at home, is a crucial treatment for these disorders. However, many patients struggle to complete their home exercises, leading to longer recovery periods or worsening conditions. To address this problem, health technologies that can monitor patients at home are ideal. This paper discusses user research with three physiotherapists and eleven patients to understand the reasons behind non-compliance with home exercises. The research used a speed dating approach and identified six insights and design recommendations, including the importance of feedback, scheduling, therapist-patient communication, and privacy in these technologies.
412131	41213160	Novel Modalities For Bimanual Scrolling On Tablet Devices	The paper discusses two studies that examine the use of new methods for scrolling on tablet devices using both hands. The techniques involve a combination of physical dial, touch, and pressure input to control the speed and direction of scrolling. The effectiveness of these techniques is compared to traditional one-handed techniques in a targeted task. The results show that participants were able to select targets more quickly and with less effort when using the bimanual techniques. This suggests that bimanual scrolling may be a more efficient and user-friendly option for tablet devices.
412131	412131183	Comparing evaluation methods for encumbrance and walking on interaction with touchscreen mobile devices	This paper compares two methods for evaluating the effects of carrying objects and using mobile devices while walking. The methods involve walking on a treadmill and walking around a predefined route while following a pacesetter. The results of a target acquisition experiment showed that accuracy significantly decreased when carrying a bag or box while walking at the preferred speed. The paper also discusses the advantages and limitations of each method and suggests that treadmill walking may not be the best approach for studying walking speed in future mobile studies.
412131	412131137	Using mobile phones to interact with tabletop computers	Tabletop computers are capable of accommodating multiple users at once, and in today's society where most people carry mobile phones, the use of these devices in conjunction with tabletop computers has become increasingly common. In a study, researchers looked at three different ways of interacting with a tabletop computer using a phone as a controller for a dial manipulation task. These interactions included directly touching the phone's screen, using it as a tangible controller on the tabletop, and manipulating the dial directly on the phone's screen. The study also examined user performance with and without tactile feedback from the phone, and found that interacting directly on the phone itself was the most efficient, with tactile feedback improving performance. However, the study also revealed various concerns that users have about using their phone as a controller. Overall, the results suggest that using a phone and tabletop together can sometimes be more effective than using the tabletop alone.
412132	41213241	Two-way source coding with a common helper	The two-way rate-distortion problem involves a helper sending a limited-rate message to both users using side information. This results in a Markov form of Helper-User 1-User 2. The achievable rates and distortions for this setup are characterized, and it is found that a binning scheme similar to Wyner-Ziv can be used to achieve the optimal rate. The side information at the decoder is the "further" user, User 2. The proof of this result uses a new technique involving undirected graphs to verify the Markov relations.
412132	412132107	Problems we can solve with a helper	This work focuses on studying source coding problems with a helper who provides limited side information to the parties involved. The first problem studied is the Wyner-Ziv problem, where the helper sends rate-limited side information to both the encoder and decoder in addition to the existing memoryless side information. A mathematical characterization of achievable rates is derived under certain Markov conditions on the source and side information. The problem of cascade rate distortion with a helper is also examined, with partial results obtained for cases where the side information is not necessarily common. This work provides insights into the use of side information in source coding problems.
412132	41213292	Secure source coding with a public helper	This article discusses secure multi-terminal source coding problems that involve a public helper. Two main scenarios are examined: source coding with a helper and triangular source coding with a helper. The article focuses on how the helper can assist with source transmission while still maintaining a constraint on the amount of leaked information due to its public nature. The tradeoff between transmission rate, distortion, and information leakage rate at the helper and eavesdropper is analyzed and a rate-distortion-leakage region is characterized for different types of problems.
412133	41213349	Extended analysis of motion-compensated frame difference for block-based motion prediction error.	In the past, designing and optimizing hybrid video codecs often relied on trial and error. However, having a theoretical model is important in order to understand and improve existing codecs. In this paper, a first-order Markov model is used to create an approximate model for the block-based motion compensation frame difference signal. The model assumes that pixel deformation is directional rather than uniform within a block. The study also shows that the accuracy of motion-compensated codecs is affected by imperfect block-based motion compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that the derived model accurately describes the statistical characteristics of the MCFD signal and reveals the impact of imperfect motion compensation on the performance of video codecs.
412133	412133181	On re-composition of motion compensated macroblocks for DCT-based video transcoding	Heterogeneous video transcoding is an important technique for achieving portability between different encoding formats and network environments. A frame-skipping transcoder is commonly used to reduce the bitrate of compressed videos, but traditional methods can lead to quality degradation and high computational complexity. To address this issue, a DCT-based frame-skipping transcoder has been proposed, but the motion compensated macroblock transcoding process in the DCT domain remains a bottleneck. In this paper, a new architecture is proposed to reduce the computational complexity by utilizing pre-computed shift operators and avoiding re-encoding errors in the dominant region. An adaptive transcoding architecture for boundary regions and error compensation methods are also introduced, resulting in a faster and more robust transcoding process. Experimental results show improved performance compared to traditional methods.
412133	412133218	New architecture for dynamic frame-skipping transcoder.	Transcoding is a crucial technique for compressing video signals and reducing their bit rate. However, a high transcoding ratio can result in poor picture quality when the full frame rate is used. To address this issue, frame skipping is often used to allocate more bits to important frames, but this can lead to complexity and re-encoding errors. In this paper, the authors propose a new architecture for frame-rate reduction in the DCT domain, which reduces complexity and re-encoding errors. They also introduce a frame-rate control scheme to adjust the number of skipped frames based on motion vectors and re-encoding errors, resulting in smoother motion and improved picture quality. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms conventional transcoding methods in terms of robustness, requantization errors, and computational complexity.
412134	41213434	Recommendation system for HBB TV: Model design and implementation	Hybrid broadcast and broadband (HBB) television has opened up new possibilities for services, including personalized recommendation systems. With the vast number of programs available, it is impossible for viewers to keep track of everything in real time. Recommendation engines were created to address the issue of information overload and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in. This paper presents the design and implementation of a recommendation system for HBB TV. The system uses an enhanced Naïve Bayes model to predict user ratings based on past observations. It is flexible and robust, able to handle sparse data sets and has shown promising results in experiments using a Yahoo movie data set. 
412134	41213464	Discovering biclusters in gene expression data based on high-dimensional linear geometries.	DNA microarray experiments involve identifying groups of genes that have similar patterns of transcription. This is important for understanding gene function, classifying tissues, and identifying regulatory motifs. However, conventional clustering algorithms often fail to detect patterns in data where only a subset of genes have consistent patterns over a subset of conditions. To address this issue, biclustering has been proposed, which focuses on identifying consistent patterns in subsets of genes and conditions. However, most existing biclustering algorithms have limitations and are based on heuristic methods. In this paper, a new geometric perspective for biclustering is presented, where biclusters are viewed as hyperplanes in a high dimensional data space. This approach allows for the detection of different types of patterns and has been shown to be effective in identifying biologically significant subsets of genes in microarray data. 
412134	41213433	Segmentation of cell nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images: An integrated framework using level set segmentation and touching-cell splitting.	This paper discusses the importance of accurate cell segmentation in fluorescence microscopy images for high-throughput applications. The proposed framework includes a new level sets based segmentation algorithm and a method for splitting touching cells. The segmentation algorithm uses a region-based active contour model and minimizes the Bayesian classification risk. The touching-cell splitting method first distinguishes touching cells from non-touching cells and then uses image properties and geodesic distance to determine the appropriate splitting line. The framework is evaluated using multiple datasets and compared to existing segmentation methods. Results show that the proposed framework performs well in segmenting cells in different types of images.
412135	41213516	Visual tracking via shallow and deep collaborative model.	The paper proposes a robust tracking method that combines a generative model and a discriminative classifier. Features are learned by shallow and deep architectures, with the generative model using a block-based incremental learning scheme and the discriminative model using deep learning techniques. The generative model also incorporates a local binary mask to handle occlusion, while the discriminative model learns generic features that are robust to background clutters and foreground appearance variations. The two models work together to achieve a balance in handling occlusion and target appearance change, which are challenging factors in visual tracking. The proposed method is evaluated against state-of-the-art algorithms and shown to be accurate and robust.
412135	4121353	Visual tracking via adaptive structural local sparse appearance model	Sparse representation has been used in visual tracking to find the best candidate with minimal reconstruction error using target templates. However, most existing methods only consider the overall representation and do not fully utilize the sparse coefficients to distinguish between the target and the background. This can lead to failure when there are similar objects or occlusions in the scene. In this paper, a new tracking method called the structural local sparse appearance model is introduced. This approach combines partial and spatial information of the target using a novel alignment-pooling method. This helps to accurately locate the target and handle occlusions. The method also incorporates a template update strategy that combines incremental subspace learning and sparse representation, which reduces drifting and the impact of occlusions. Experiments on challenging datasets show that this method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
412135	41213528	On feature combination and multiple kernel learning for object tracking	This paper introduces a new approach for tracking objects using multiple kernel learning (MKL). This method combines χ2 and Gaussian kernels to capture different features, such as color and spatial pyramid histograms (SPH). The MKL classifier is updated online, with useful tracking objects automatically selected as support vectors. This approach effectively handles variations in target appearance and utilizes history information to better distinguish the target from the background. Experiments on real-world sequences show that this method can accurately and robustly track objects, even under challenging conditions like partial occlusion and significant appearance changes.
412136	41213648	Generic Attacks on Secure Outsourced Databases.	Various protocols have been suggested for securely outsourcing database storage to a third party server, ranging from those with strong cryptographic security to more practical implementations. However, new attacks have shown that confidentiality of the data can still be compromised. The need for a formal understanding of the efficiency and privacy trade-off in outsourced database systems is recognized, and abstract models are proposed to capture them. These models identify two sources of leakage - access patterns and communication volume. Generic reconstruction attacks are developed for systems supporting range queries, where either of these sources is leaked. These attacks are shown to be optimal and can successfully recover secret attributes of all records in a database after a certain number of queries. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks on real datasets.
412136	41213629	Efficient Set Intersection with Simulation-Based Security	This study focuses on finding a solution for combining private datasets between two parties, which is useful for online collaboration. The researchers propose protocols that utilize homomorphic encryption and hashing techniques for secure computation in both semi-honest and malicious environments. The protocol for the semi-honest environment is secure in the standard model, while the one for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. The protocols have a linear overhead in terms of communication and computation. Different variants of the semi-honest protocol are also implemented and tested, revealing that the best performing variant may vary depending on the input size.
412136	41213644	Efficient communication-storage tradeoffs for multicast encryption	This article discusses re-keying protocols for secure multicasting in a dynamic multicast group with a center. The authors propose an improved scheme with sub-linear center storage, while maintaining efficiency in other parameters. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme by applying it to various benchmark scenarios. The article also presents lower bounds on the tradeoff between communication and user storage, and shows that the proposed scheme is nearly optimal with respect to these bounds. Overall, the scheme efficiently accommodates a wide range of multicast scenarios while minimizing storage and communication requirements. 
412137	41213769	Automatic initialization for facial analysis in interactive robotics	This paper discusses the importance of the human face in communication and presents a soft real-time vision system that allows a robot to analyze faces and recognize facial expressions as non-verbal cues. The system uses a robust detection scheme to identify faces and basic facial features, and then extracts facial parameters using active appearance models and support vector machine classifiers to identify individuals and their facial expressions. The paper evaluates four different methods for initializing the AAM algorithm and their performance in classifying facial expressions using the DaFEx database and real-world data from a robot's perspective.
412137	41213735	Vision systems with the human in the loop	The emerging cognitive vision paradigm involves using machine learning and automatic reasoning in vision systems to learn from what they see. These cognitive vision systems possess the ability to evaluate and adapt to their surroundings, making them highly robust. This article discusses three such systems: one for content-based image retrieval and two prototype systems that use contextual knowledge for visual analysis. All three systems are designed to interact with humans. The article also delves into the topic of assessing cognitive systems, including the use of psychological evaluations and usability experiments. The potential of these experiments is highlighted through examples of human-machine interactions. 
412137	4121371	From Image Features To Symbols And Vice Versa - Using Graphs To Loop Data- And Model-Driven Processing In Visual Assembly Recognition	Graphs and graph matching are useful tools in knowledge representation, pattern recognition, and machine learning, particularly in computer vision. They can represent relationships between image features and symbolic object knowledge, making them versatile in recognition tasks. This article presents a system that utilizes graphs to bridge the gap between different levels of knowledge representation. The system integrates bottom-up and top-down strategies for recognition and automatically generates and learns graph models to recognize assembled objects. This process involves recognizing elementary objects, analyzing clusters of objects, and translating assembly structures into graphs. These graphs are then stored in a database for future recognition tasks. Additionally, the graphs allow for top-down knowledge propagation, enabling faster and more efficient recognition. 
412138	41213869	How to forget a secret	A new type of attack has been discovered that can affect any cryptographic protocol. This attack exploits the physical memory of a participant, allowing the attacker to access all previous states. To protect against this type of attack, a new cryptographic primitive called "erasable memory" has been introduced. This primitive allows for the secure deletion of secret information. By using a small amount of erasable memory, a large non-erasable memory can be transformed into a large erasable memory. This transformation can be achieved using a simple assumption and can be implemented using a block cipher, making it efficient. Suggestions for implementing small amounts of erasable memory are also provided.
412138	41213856	Private Selective Payment Protocols	This article discusses a payment protocol where a server can make a payment to one of several clients, based on a given function. This type of protocol is commonly used in financial transactions like auctions and lotteries. The authors propose a private selective payment protocol for this scenario, where the server does not learn any private information about the clients. They also present an efficient protocol for the case where the function selects the client with the highest private input. This protocol is information-theoretically private and protects against a curious server. The key technique used is a new form of oblivious transfer called symmetrically-private conditional oblivious transfer.
412138	41213815	Practical and Privacy-Preserving Policy Compliance for Outsourced Data.	This article discusses a scenario where a client wants to access a data owner's database through a server, and the challenge of designing protocols that ensure the client's queries comply with the data owner's policy while also preserving privacy. The authors propose a cryptographic model for studying such protocols and present a set of protocols that meet various requirements, including correctness, privacy, and efficiency. They also highlight the use of equality-preserving encryption and query rewriting techniques as key technical contributions. These protocols are significantly faster than traditional methods and maintain privacy of the compliance result.
412139	412139108	The principled design of large-scale recursive neural network architectures--dag-rnns and the protein structure prediction problem	The article proposes a methodology for designing large-scale recursive neural network architectures called DAG-RNNs. This methodology involves three steps: representing a domain using directed acyclic graphs, parameterizing relationships between variables using feedforward neural networks, and applying weight-sharing within subsets of the graphs. This approach allows for efficient processing and training of various data structures with different sizes and dimensions. The resulting models are probabilistic, but their internal dynamics are deterministic, making them suitable for tackling large-scale problems. The article also discusses specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and structured graphs, and their applications in predicting protein structural features. The article concludes by discussing extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for neural architecture design. The protein prediction servers can be accessed online at www.igb.uci.edu/tools.htm.
412139	41213936	Machine learning methods for computational proteomics and beyond	Protein structure prediction is a key challenge in biology, particularly in the genomic age where a large proportion of newly discovered genes have unknown structure and function. With the exponential growth of sequence and structure data, machine learning methods have become essential in tackling this problem. Among these methods, neural networks have achieved remarkable success, including the development of the most accurate secondary structure predictors. This article provides an overview of the authors' work and the current state-of-the-art in several areas of protein structure prediction, such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contacts, and three-dimensional and interchain beta-sheet structures. The authors' methods are based on graphical models and use deterministic recursive neural networks for faster learning. Lessons learned from these methods can also be applied to other complex neural architectures.
412139	4121396	Deep architectures for protein contact map prediction	Residue-residue contact prediction is crucial for protein structure prediction and other applications, but current predictors have low accuracy for long-range contacts. To address this issue, a novel machine learning approach called CMAPpro was developed. It uses three steps to progressively improve contact map prediction: 2D recursive neural networks for coarse contacts and orientations, an energy-based method for aligning secondary structure elements and predicting contact probabilities, and a deep neural network for organizing and refining predictions. CMAPpro was trained on a large set of non-redundant proteins and tested on non-homologous domains and in CASP8 and CASP9 experiments. The results showed a significant increase in accuracy for long-range contacts, with CMAPpro achieving close to 30% accuracy. CMAPpro is available as part of the SCRATCH suite and supplementary data is available online.
412140	4121404	On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other	The concept of cognitive dynamic systems combines engineering and cognitive neuroscience to create a better understanding of cognitive perception and control. Bayesian inference is used to improve sparse coding, a method used in neuroscience, and incorporate information filtering to enhance cognitive perception. Bellman's dynamic programming is then applied to cognitive control, resulting in a new reinforcement learning algorithm with desirable properties. The paper also addresses how to integrate cognitive control and perception, as well as how to manage risk, by using probabilistic reasoning and a preadaptive control mechanism. This mechanism involves a closed-loop feedback structure that utilizes past experiences to control motor actions and executive attention.
412140	41214070	A Novel Model-Based Hearing Compensation Design Using a Gradient-Free Optimization Method	A new model-based hearing compensation strategy and gradient-free optimization procedure is proposed for designing a learning-based hearing aid. Inspired by physiological data and auditory nerve models, the strategy aims to improve speech enhancement and compensate for hearing loss by approaching it as a neural coding problem. A Neurocompensator is designed to achieve this, and a gradient-free optimization procedure, based on the ALOPEX algorithm, is used to learn its parameters. The methodology, learning procedure, and experimental results are presented, along with a discussion on the use of unsupervised learning and optimization methods. This approach has potential for improving the performance of hearing aids.
412140	41214065	Bayesian Sequential State Estimation for MIMO Wireless Communications	This paper discusses the use of particle filters, a Bayesian estimation method, for tracking variations in the channel matrix of a narrowband MIMO wireless channel. The aim is to improve receiver performance by acquiring channel state information through a semi-blind strategy. The paper compares the particle filter and an improved version using gradient information to the conventional Kalman filter and mixture Kalman filter in terms of receiver performance and computational complexity. Real-life MIMO wireless data, including differential phase modulation, is used for the comparisons. The results show that the particle filter methods outperform the conventional filters in terms of performance and computational complexity.
412141	41214132	The Prediction of Student First Response Using Prerequisite Skills	Educational data analytics has mostly focused on predicting student next problem correctness, but this may not be the most useful for teachers. Instead, it is important to predict more meaningful aspects of student knowledge over a longer period of time. This paper proposes a method that uses prerequisite information, recorded by learning systems like ASSISTments and Khan Academy, to predict students' initial knowledge on a subsequent skill. Comparing this method to the standard Knowledge Tracing model and majority class, the results show that it is a reliable way to predict student knowledge without sacrificing accuracy. This method could help teachers better understand and support their students' learning.
412141	41214180	The Opportunity Count Model: A Flexible Approach to Modeling Student Performance.	The study focuses on the use of detailed performance data to improve the accuracy of predicting student performance in intelligent tutoring systems. The Opportunity Count Model (OCM) is introduced, which uses separate models for different opportunity counts (OCs) rather than one blanket model. The OCM is constructed using Random Forest (RF) and considers detailed performance data from tutor log files. Results show that OC is important in modeling student performance and that the detailed performance data varies across different OCs. This suggests that considering OC can lead to stronger student models and improve the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems.
412141	41214148	How to construct more accurate student models: comparing and optimizing knowledge tracing and performance factor analysis	This paper compares two approaches for student modeling, Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Performance Factors Analysis (PFA), by evaluating their predictive accuracy on individual student practice opportunities. The study explores the design decisions for each approach and determines a set of "best practices" for each. PFA was found to have higher predictive accuracy and more plausible parameter estimates compared to KT. The best-performing model was a variant of PFA that ignored the tutor's transfer model, suggesting that there is benefit in considering models that incorporate information from more than the typical handful of skills associated with a problem. However, both models had relatively low predictive accuracy for incorrect responses, indicating a need for a better means of determining when students will make mistakes.
412142	41214276	Stochastic optimization for collision selection in high energy physics	Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important in basic science research, particularly in high energy physics. AI methods can assist in precision measurements, such as determining the mass of the top quark. This is achieved by selecting collisions at high energy particle accelerators that produce top quarks, while minimizing other particles (background). Current methods for collision selection rely on heuristics or supervised learning, which are not always optimal. A new approach using stochastic optimization has been developed to directly search for selectors that minimize statistical uncertainty in the top quark mass measurement. This method has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of the measurement, contributing to our understanding of the top quark. 
412142	4121426	Empirical Studies in Action Selection with Reinforcement Learning	This article discusses the importance of sophisticated action selection policies for intelligent agents to excel in challenging tasks. It focuses on two popular approaches to reinforcement learning (RL): temporal difference (TD) methods, which learn value functions, and evolutionary methods, which optimize populations of candidate policies. These approaches have had practical successes, but there have been few studies directly comparing them or attempting to combine their strengths. The article presents three empirical studies, including a benchmark task and ways to make evolutionary algorithms more effective at online tasks by borrowing mechanisms from TD methods. It also introduces a novel approach of using evolution to discover good representations for TD function approximators, which outperforms both TD and evolutionary methods alone.
412142	41214215	The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge.	Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular area of research in recent years. One particular challenge in this field is partially observable, cooperative, multi-agent learning, where teams of agents must coordinate their behavior based on their own private observations. This is an important area of research as it relates to real-world systems and can be more easily evaluated compared to general-sum problems. However, there is currently no standard benchmark for cooperative multi-agent RL, leading to most papers using one-off toy problems. To address this, the authors propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) using the popular real-time strategy game StarCraft II. SMAC offers a diverse set of challenge maps and recommendations for benchmarking and evaluations, as well as a deep multi-agent RL learning framework and state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors believe that SMAC will serve as a standard benchmark for years to come. 
412143	41214335	Weighted Online Problems with Advice.	The class is concerned with online problems where each request must be accepted or rejected and the goal is to minimize or maximize the number of accepted requests while maintaining a feasible solution. All -complete problems have the same advice complexity. This paper studies weighted versions of problems in , where each request has a weight and the aim is to minimize or maximize the total weight of accepted requests. Unlike unweighted versions, there is a significant difference in the advice complexity of complete minimization and maximization problems. The techniques for dealing with weighted requests can also be applied to non-complete problems like Matching and scheduling, achieving better results.
412143	41214326	Bounds on certain multiplications of affine combinations	Given two n × n matrices, A and B, with entries that are affine combinations of a set of variables, a 1 ,…, a m , and b 1 ,…, b m over the finite field GF(2), the maximum value of m is being considered in relation to the product matrix C = A · B. This question has arisen in the context of improving the communication complexity of zero-knowledge proofs. The current upper bound of n 2 is improved to n 2 3 3 + O (n) , with tighter bounds being obtained for smaller values of n. The bounds have been shown to be tight for n = 2, 3, and 4.
412143	41214345	The frequent items problem in online streaming under various performance measures	This paper discusses the Frequent Items Problem and presents new results and analysis for this fundamental online streaming problem. The study includes the use of alternative performance measures to supplement the insights gained from competitive analysis and contributes to the general understanding of performance measures for online algorithms. The authors also compare and contrast the use of different performance measures, including competitive analysis, relative interval analysis, and relative worst order analysis, on the Frequent Items Problem. This work builds on previous research that has identified limitations of competitive analysis and explores the effectiveness of alternative measures.
412144	4121449	Asynchronous Multiparty Computation: Theory and Implementation	The proposed protocol is an asynchronous method for multiparty computation that ensures perfect security. It has a communication complexity of n^2|C|k, with n being the number of parties, |C| being the size of the arithmetic circuit, and k being the size of elements in the underlying field. The protocol guarantees termination by allowing a preprocessing phase to finish without releasing any information. It is as efficient as a passively secure solution, and can withstand an adaptive and active adversary corrupting less than n/3 players. A software framework called VIFF is also presented, which allows for automatic parallelization of secure operations. Benchmarking results show that this protocol can be applied to practical and complex computations.
412144	41214495	On the amortized complexity of zero knowledge protocols for multiplicative relations	The protocol presented allows for zero-knowledge proofs of committed values satisfying a specific equation, with a linear size in the error probability and logarithmic in the number of values. This leads to a vanishing amortized complexity as the number of values increases. The protocol can also be made information theoretically secure with preprocessing. It can be used to create a perfect zero-knowledge interactive proof for circuit satisfiability and can be generalized for verifying multiple instances of an algebraic circuit with a cost dependent on the circuit's multiplicative depth. The protocol can also be applied to commitments to integers, with a low amortized complexity and improved security compared to previous solutions.
412144	41214459	Multiparty Computation from Threshold Homomorphic Encryption	This article presents a new approach to secure multiparty computation (MPC) using homomorphic threshold cryptosystems. This method allows for the creation of MPC protocols that are secure against active adversaries, even if a minority of parties are corrupted. The communication complexity of this approach is O(nk|C|), where n is the number of parties, k is the security parameter, and |C| is the size of the circuit used to compute the function. This is an improvement over previous proposals, which either only provided security against passive adversaries or had a higher communication complexity. The article also provides two examples of threshold cryptosystems that can be used for this approach.
412145	41214563	An ASP-Based Data Integration System	Information integration systems play a key role in combining data from different sources to provide users with a unified view, known as a global schema. While simple integration scenarios have been extensively studied and efficient systems exist, challenges arise when constraints on the data quality are imposed, leading to ambiguous results. Significant research has been devoted to addressing these challenges, but no efficient system has been implemented yet. This paper presents a new data integration system utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) and various optimizations to enable consistent query answering (CQA) for large datasets. This system aims to improve the integration process and provide more reliable results.
412145	41214572	The INFOMIX system for advanced integration of incomplete and inconsistent data	Information integration systems are responsible for combining data from different sources to create a unified view, known as a global schema, for users. This allows users to query the data without needing knowledge about the sources. With the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web, there has been an increase in the number of information sources available to users, which are often autonomous, heterogeneous, and widely distributed. As a result, information integration has become a crucial issue in various areas such as distributed databases, cooperative information systems, data warehousing, and on-demand computing. It is estimated that the information integration market will reach $10 billion by 2006.
412145	41214547	Magic Sets for disjunctive Datalog programs	This paper introduces a new technique for optimizing partially bound queries over disjunctive Datalog programs with stratified negation. The technique builds upon the Magic Set optimization method, originally designed for non-disjunctive programs, by utilizing the propagation of query bindings. Unlike previous methods, this approach can be applied during the non-deterministic phase of computation, allowing for dynamic pruning of the search space. The correctness of the method is proven through a strong relationship between Magic Sets and unfounded sets. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world data show significant performance gains compared to previous methods for disjunctive Datalog programs. This technique has been implemented in the DLV system and has potential for improving query performance in applications dealing with inconsistent databases.
412146	41214633	The DLV system for knowledge representation and reasoning	Disjunctive Logic Programming (DLP) is a powerful formalism for representing and reasoning about knowledge, capable of expressing properties of finite structures that are decidable in the complexity class ΣP2 (NPNP). This makes DLP more expressive than normal logic programming, which is limited to properties decidable in NP. Disjunction in DLP allows for simpler and more natural representation of problems of lower complexity. DLV is a widely used implementation of DLP and is able to handle complex problems up to ΔP3-complete problems. It also allows for the use of weak constraints to express optimization problems. DLV has been extensively tested and benchmarked, showing its potential for applications such as knowledge management and information integration.
412146	41214618	Enhancing DLV instantiator by backjumping techniques	Disjunctive logic programming (DLP) is a powerful tool for representing and reasoning about knowledge. Its expressive language and efficient systems have made it popular in fields like Knowledge Management and Information Integration. However, as these applications often deal with large amounts of data, there is a need to improve the efficiency of DLP instantiators. This is the first step in a DLP computation, where variables are replaced with constants to create a ground program. The efficiency of this process is crucial for solving real-world problems. To address this issue, a new backjumping algorithm has been developed that uses both the semantic and structural information of a rule to generate only relevant ground instances, resulting in improved efficiency. Experiments on benchmark problems have shown positive results, with the new technique significantly improving the performance of the DLV DLP system.
412146	4121463	Fair Division Rules For Funds Distribution: The Case Of The Italian Research Assessment Program (Vqr 2004-2010)	The distribution of resources or tasks among collaborating agents is crucial for maximizing the social welfare of a structure. This paper addresses the issue of dividing earnings, such as money, in a fair manner among participating agents in the context of the Italian research assessment program (VQR). Several desirable properties for a fair division rule are identified and applied to the case-study of fund distribution to Italian research structures. The proposed solution, based on the Shapley value, is shown to meet all the desirable properties and can be effectively implemented in the VQR and similar applications. The entire process, from product selection to preventing strategic behaviors, is also discussed.
412147	4121476	Lexical Selection for Cross-Language Applications: Combining LCS with WordNet	This paper discusses experiments conducted to test the usefulness of large-scale resources for lexical selection in machine translation (MT) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). The authors propose that verbs with similar argument structures have shared meaning components that are more relevant for argument realization than for individual verb meanings. This is supported by the finding that verbs with similar argument structures, as represented in Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS), are rarely synonymous in WordNet. Based on this, the authors developed an algorithm for cross-language selection of lexical items that combines the strengths of both LCS and WordNet. The algorithm was implemented using the Parka Knowledge-Based System and tested on a knowledge base containing both types of information.
412147	41214747	Iterative translation disambiguation for cross-language information retrieval	The distribution of translation probabilities greatly affects the effectiveness of cross-language information retrieval systems. This paper presents a new method for calculating translation probabilities using a bilingual dictionary and target language corpus. The algorithm combines term association measures with iterative machine learning, resulting in more robust results than approaches using higher n-grams. By considering only pairs of translation candidates, the method is less affected by data-sparseness issues. The learned translation probabilities are then used as query term weights in a vector-space retrieval system, leading to significant improvements in English-German cross-lingual retrieval compared to a baseline using dictionary lookup without term weighting.
412147	4121475	A parameterized approach to integrating aspect with lexical-semantics for machine translation	This paper discusses a two-level knowledge representation model for machine translation that integrates aspectual information with lexical-semantic information through parameterization. This integration is crucial in machine translation because of the numerous lexical and aspectual possibilities that exist when translating a sentence from one language to another. The aspectual information from the source language sentence guides the selection of target language terms, which then affects the generation of aspect. This creates a two-way communication channel between the two processes. The paper shows how this selection and realization process can be parameterized to work across multiple languages, and how this approach is currently being used to extract aspectual information from corpora.
412148	41214852	On minmax theorems for multiplayer games	The authors present a generalization of von Neumann's minmax theorem to a class of separable multiplayer zero-sum games. These games are polymatrix, where every edge represents a two-player game with a zero total sum of payoffs. This generalization implies convexity of equilibria, polynomial-time tractability, and convergence of no-regret learning algorithms to Nash equilibria. This class of games is the broadest class to which tractability results can be applied. The authors also explore generalizations to non-constant-sum games, specifically polymatrix games with strictly competitive games on their edges. They show that the complexity of these games is PPAD-complete, indicating a significant difference from zero-sum games. Additionally, they examine the role of coordination in networked interactions and show that finding a pure Nash equilibrium in coordination-only polymatrix games is PLS-complete, while combining coordination and zero-sum games results in PPAD-completeness. 
412148	41214815	On the complexity of Nash equilibria of action-graph games	We examine the computational complexity of finding Nash equilibria in action-graph games (AGGs), which combine local dependencies and partial indifference to other agents' identities. We present an efficient approximation scheme for computing mixed Nash equilibria in AGGs with certain conditions, but also show that the problem becomes intractable when these conditions are relaxed. Specifically, we demonstrate that even with a tree action graph, it is NP-complete to find a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a mixed Nash equilibrium with an arbitrary number of agent types. These results highlight the difficulty of efficiently computing equilibria in multi-player games and complement previous findings on graphical games and anonymous games.
412148	41214851	Computing Equilibria in Large Games We Play	Traditional methods of representing games require a lot of information, making them impractical for large games with many players. This is due to the complexity of describing the game and the unknown or redundant information needed to populate the payoff matrices. To address this issue, succinct representations like graphical games have been proposed, which use a graph to represent player interactions and reduce description complexity. However, computing Nash equilibria in these games is a difficult problem. A different type of succinct game called anonymous games, where players are unaware of each other's identities, has been shown to be more suitable for modeling practical games like congestion and auction settings. A polynomial time approximation scheme for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games is proposed.
412149	41214962	Extending FolkRank with content data	The article discusses the problem of recommending tags for new or untagged documents in real-world tagging datasets. Most existing approaches focus on artificially created datasets where the user and document information is known, rather than addressing the challenge of recommending tags for new documents. In this paper, the authors propose a novel adaptation to the FolkRank algorithm by incorporating content data. This allows FolkRank to recommend tags for new documents based on their textual content. The results show that this adaptation improves FolkRank's performance on full tagging datasets, but a simpler content-aware tag recommender outperforms it. The authors suggest that further optimization of FolkRank's weighting method is needed for better results.
412149	41214977	Testing and evaluating tag recommenders in a live system	The challenge of providing tag recommendations for collaborative tagging systems has received significant attention from researchers. However, most of the research has focused on developing and evaluating methods, rather than addressing practical challenges such as integrating recommendation methods into real tagging systems and assessing their performance. This paper describes a tag recommendation framework designed for the social bookmark and publication sharing system, BibSonomy. The framework is easily extensible, open to various methods, and can be used independently from BibSonomy. Two recommendation methods deployed in the framework are also evaluated in this paper. The aim of the framework is to facilitate the development, testing, and evaluation of recommendation algorithms and foster collaboration with researchers.
412149	4121497	Evaluating similarity measures for emergent semantics of social tagging	Social bookmarking systems are becoming increasingly important for Semantic Web applications, with their information structures known as folksonomies. A key question is how to adapt traditional similarity measures to folksonomies for tasks like community detection, navigation support, and ontology learning. This study compares various folksonomy-based similarity measures, considering users, tags, and resources. Results show that mutual information with distributional micro-aggregation is the most accurate but not scalable, while per-user projection with collaborative aggregation is the best scalable approach. These findings hold for both tag and resource similarity. The study also uses external validation from user-validated semantic proxies to confirm the results.
412150	41215015	Visually exploring movement data via similarity-based analysis	The article discusses the importance of data analysis and knowledge discovery in moving object databases, particularly for tasks like traffic management and location-based services. Similarity search over trajectories is crucial for these tasks, but existing methods often use generic metrics that do not consider the complexity of trajectory data. To address this issue, the authors propose a framework that includes various trajectory similarity measures based on both primitive and derived parameters. These measures can be used for trajectory data mining, such as clustering and classification. The proposed measures are evaluated through experiments on synthetic and real trajectory datasets, highlighting their effectiveness and potential for visual analytics in trajectory data analysis. 
412150	41215060	Algorithms for Nearest Neighbor Search on Moving Object Trajectories	The Nearest Neighbor (NN) search is a crucial aspect of spatial and spatiotemporal database research, especially with the increasing use of Mobile Location Services (MLS). Most existing literature on NN query processing focuses on either stationary or moving query points over static datasets or predicted locations over continuously moving points. However, with the rise of MLS, there is a growing need for efficient k-NN query processing over historical trajectory data to improve existing services and create new ones. This paper explores methods for NN search on R-tree-like structures that store historical information about moving object trajectories. The proposed algorithms differ based on the type of query object and result, resulting in four types of NN queries. The authors also introduce new metrics to support their search strategies, and their implementation on two R-tree variants (TB-tree and 3D-R-tree) is tested on large datasets to demonstrate their scalability and efficiency.
412150	41215063	On temporal-constrained sub-trajectory cluster analysis.	This paper discusses the problem of cluster analysis in Moving Object Databases (MODs) and presents a novel solution for the temporal-constrained sub-trajectory cluster analysis problem. This problem involves discovering clusters of sub-trajectories within a specified time window, which is challenging due to the constantly updating nature of MODs. Existing solutions are inefficient, as they require filtering the database and applying a clustering algorithm from scratch for each query. To address this, the paper proposes an incremental and scalable solution based on a new indexing structure called Representative Trajectory Tree (ReTraTree). Experimental results show that this approach outperforms a state-of-the-art in-DBMS solution by a significant margin.
412151	41215169	Recursive Structure And Motion Estimation From Noisy Uncalibrated Video Sequences	This paper introduces a new approach for estimating structure and camera focal length and motion. The method combines discrete and continuous methods to effectively handle image noise and outliers. It builds upon an existing framework and incorporates a simple structure estimation scheme. This allows for the system to handle varying focal lengths of the camera. The structure obtained from previous image frames is used to improve estimates for the current frame, and a RANSAC outlier rejection scheme is utilized. The system's performance is demonstrated through simulated experiments.
412151	41215158	Self-calibration from image derivatives for active vision systems	This paper presents a method for calibrating a camera on a robot when the hand-eye transformation between the two is unknown. The calibration uses spatial and temporal derivatives in an image sequence and does not require feature matching or a reference object. The calibration can be performed on an active robot vision system with controlled motion of the robot hand. The algorithm only uses image derivatives and known robot hand motion. A minimum of 3 non-coplanar translations of the hand are needed for the calculation. The method also calculates the orientation and position of the camera with respect to the robot hand. The full calibration involves 5 distinct motions and has been tested for noise sensitivity in experiments.
412151	41215114	Affine Approximation for Direct Batch Recovery of Euclidian Structure and Motion from Sparse Data	A new algorithm has been developed for recovering the motion of a camera from sparse image data. It aims to use as much available information as possible while minimizing computational steps. This method falls between factorization schemes, which use all available information, and sequential approaches, which handle sparse data. The algorithm approximates Euclidean camera matrices using the affine camera model, avoiding the need for intermediate projective reconstruction. A closure constraint, the FA-closure, is used to linearly formulate the camera coefficients in the affine fundamental matrices. This leads to better conditioning and more flexibility in regularizing the estimation of motion parameters. The resulting autocalibration scheme is guaranteed to produce a Least Squares Estimate. The effectiveness of this method has been demonstrated through experiments on real and synthetic data.
412152	41215265	Sensor Noise Modeling Using The Skellam Distribution: Application To The Color Edge Detection	The Skellam distribution is proposed as a noise model for CCD or CMOS cameras, derived from the Poisson distribution of photons that determine the sensor response. It can measure intensity differences in both spatial and temporal domains, and the parameters are linearly related to pixel intensity. This allows for automatic detection of color differences and edge detection in images. The approach does not require Gaussian smoothing and is able to extract fine details of image structures, such as edges and corners, without being dependent on camera settings. The algorithm only needs a confidence interval for a hypothesis test, making it a more efficient and accurate method.
412152	412152186	Difference-based Image Noise Modeling Using Skellam Distribution.	This article discusses the limitations of traditional assumptions about pixel intensity in quantum physics and proposes a new approach using the Skellam distribution. The Skellam distribution is derived from the Poisson photon noise model and allows for a linear relationship between intensity and Skellam parameters. This relationship remains consistent across different scenes, illuminations, and camera parameters. The article also introduces practical methods for obtaining this relationship using color patterns and natural illumination images.

412152	412152159	Automatic Edge Detection Method For The Mobile Robot Application	This paper presents a new edge detection method for mobile robot localization that does not require any parameter adjustments. The method uses a 3x3 ideal binary pattern and lookup table to divide pixels into two groups based on their intensity. The edge magnitude and orientation are calculated using the difference in average intensities and a directional code from the LUT. The input image is also partitioned into groups based on intensity similarities and the thresholds are determined automatically using fuzzy reasoning. The proposed method is robust to illumination changes in a corridor environment and is applied to mobile robot localization using projective invariance of the cross ratio. Non-maximum suppression and edge linking techniques are used to determine the final edges.

412154	412154130	Approximation Algorithms for Degree-Constrained Minimum-Cost Network-Design Problems	The article discusses network-design problems with two main objectives: minimizing the total cost of edges and nodes in the network, and limiting the maximum degree of any node. An example of this is the degree-constrained node-weighted Steiner tree problem, where the goal is to construct a Steiner tree that includes all specified terminals while keeping the degree of each node within a given limit and minimizing the total cost. The main result presented is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that produces a Steiner tree with a maximum node degree of and a cost of times that of a minimum-cost tree that also follows the degree constraint. This result can also be applied to constructing one-connected networks like generalized Steiner forests. The article also explores special cases with better approximation guarantees if the edge costs follow the triangle inequality. 
412155	41215545	Topology control in constant rate mobile ad hoc networks	Topology control is a crucial issue in ad hoc networks, where power levels must be assigned to nodes to create a desired network topology while minimizing energy consumption. While previous research has focused on stationary networks, this paper addresses topology control in mobile wireless ad hoc networks (MANETs). A model called the constant rate mobile network (CRMN) is introduced, where the speed and direction of each moving node are known. The goal is to minimize the maximum power used by any node in maintaining a specific graph property, such as network connectivity. The paper presents general frameworks for solving both the decision and optimization versions of the topology control problem under the CRMN model, with efficient algorithms for specific graph properties like network connectivity. This work paves the way for developing efficient and reliable distributed algorithms for topology control in MANETs.
412155	4121555	Topology Control For Simple Mobile Networks	Topology control in ad hoc networks involves optimizing power levels to create a desired network structure while minimizing energy consumption.

Using the Simple Mobile Network model, the goal is to minimize the maximum power used by any node to maintain connectivity. Three polynomial algorithms are proposed for solving this problem, with the fastest one performing as well as the best known algorithm for stationary networks. This study highlights the importance of considering mobility in topology control for MANETs.
412155	41215513	Topology Control For Constant Rate Mobile Networks	The topology of a wireless ad hoc network is crucial for its performance, and one way to control it is by assigning appropriate transmission power levels to nodes. This minimizes a specified function of the powers assigned. While this has been extensively studied for stationary networks, there are limited theoretical results for mobile wireless networks (MANETs). This paper focuses on the topology control problem for MANETs, specifically under the Constant Rate Mobile Network model.

412156	41215623	Strategies for mapping dataflow blocks to distributed hardware	Distributed processors must strike a balance between communication and concurrency when distributing instructions among processors. The level of concurrency plays a significant role in determining the importance of this balance. Higher concurrency allows for wider distribution of instructions, while lower concurrency benefits from mapping dependent instructions close together to reduce communication costs. This study examines these tradeoffs for distributed Explicit Dataflow Graph Execution (EDGE) architectures, which execute dataflow instructions in blocks. The results show that the best approach for mapping blocks to cores varies based on the width of the cores. An adaptive strategy that varies the number of cores for each block improves performance over fixed strategies for single and dual-issue cores, but the benefits decrease as the cores' issue width increases. These findings suggest that choosing the right runtime block mapping strategy can increase average performance by 18% while reducing average operand communication by 70%, making it a promising method for balancing communication and concurrency in distributed processors. 
412156	41215648	Techniques for reducing overheads of shared-memory multiprocessing	This study examines techniques to reduce overheads in shared-memory multiprocessor communication using the Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) and the SPLASH benchmark suite. Three techniques were analyzed: efficient synchronization primitives, weakened memory ordering constraints, and optimization of the cache-coherence protocol for two-node data sharing. Simulations were performed for current and anticipated technology, with the results showing that the QOLB hardware primitive had the largest and most consistent improvement. Relaxing memory ordering constraints also provided a consistent performance boost. The study also found that technological improvements increase both the overheads and the success of the optimization techniques in reducing them. The results suggest that these techniques are largely orthogonal and can be used concurrently to further improve performance.
412156	41215621	Convergent Compilation Applied to Loop Unrolling	In order to improve the efficiency of compilers, careful optimizations, heuristic policies, and phase ordering are used. However, designing a single heuristic that works well with other phases is difficult. While compiler designers evaluate these heuristics and phases before deployment, they do not typically evaluate or refine them during compilation. This paper introduces the concept of convergent compilation, where the compiler can statically evaluate the effectiveness of its heuristics and phases and modify them if necessary. This approach is particularly useful for architectures with conflicting resource constraints, such as TRIPS, where optimizations like loop unrolling can be adjusted after code generation based on the final instruction count. Convergent compilation can also help solve other compilation challenges and is well suited for architectures with resource constraints.
412157	4121579	Transparent Offloading and Mapping (TOM): Enabling Programmer-Transparent Near-Data Processing in GPU Systems.	Modern GPU systems face a critical bottleneck in main memory bandwidth due to limited off-chip pin bandwidth. 3D-stacked memory architectures have the potential to alleviate this bottleneck by directly connecting a logic layer to the DRAM layers with high bandwidth connections. Recent research has shown that offloading bandwidth-intensive computations to a GPU in each logic layer can significantly improve performance. However, the challenge lies in enabling computation offloading and data mapping without burdening the programmer. To address this, the paper introduces two new mechanisms: a compiler-based technique to automatically identify code for offloading and a software/hardware cooperative mechanism to predict and place frequently accessed memory pages in the closest memory stack. These mechanisms, known as TOM, are able to transparently improve performance by up to 76% without requiring any program modifications.
412157	41215771	A Hierarchical Thread Scheduler and Register File for Energy-Efficient Throughput Processors	Modern GPUs use a large number of hardware threads to hide latency in both function units and memory access. However, this requires a complex thread scheduler and a large and expensive register file. To reduce energy consumption on these massively-threaded processors, two techniques are proposed. The first is a two-level thread scheduler that maintains a smaller set of active threads and a larger set of pending threads. This reduces the number of threads the scheduler needs to consider, improving energy efficiency. The second is a hierarchical register file that replaces the monolithic register file found in current designs. This reduces energy by only allocating entries in the upper levels of the hierarchy for active threads. On average, this can reduce register file energy by 54&percnt; in real world workloads. 
412157	41215732	Late-binding: enabling unordered load-store queues	In this paper, the authors propose techniques to improve the efficiency of load/store queues (LSQs) in superscalar processors by using late binding, which allocates entries when instructions issue rather than when they are dispatched. This approach allows for smaller LSQs and can be scaled to large-window designs by breaking the LSQs into address-interleaved banks. The authors also show how to provide full LSQ functionality in an unordered design with minimal performance loss. To handle overflows in larger designs, classic network flow control techniques are applied. The proposed design achieves full hardware memory disambiguation for a 1,024 instruction window with low power requirements.
412158	4121584	An Algorithm for Multi-Criteria Optimization in CSPs	Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization are crucial concepts in Artificial Intelligence, but in real-life applications, it may be necessary to optimize multiple functions simultaneously. This paper introduces a new algorithm for solving Multi-Criteria Optimization problems in this scenario.

It utilizes Point Quad-Trees to efficiently represent the non-dominated frontier and provides superior results compared to other commonly used methods.
412158	41215823	Constraint Propagation and Value Acquisition: Why we should do it Interactively	In Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), the values for variable domains must be known before constraint propagation can begin. However, in some cases, acquiring these values can be time-consuming or not possible at the start of the problem. To address this issue, an Interactive Constraint Satisfaction Problem (ICSP) model has been developed. This model allows for the acquisition of variable domain values during the resolution process through Interactive Constraints. This approach has been tested on randomly generated CSPs and in 3D object recognition, and has shown to be effective. 
412158	41215850	An application of constraint solving for home health care.

The article concludes by demonstrating that an and-parallel implementation can be achieved with only O(1) overhead on an extended pointer machine.
412160	412160230	Joint Channel Estimation and Data Detection for MIMO-OFDM Two-Way Relay Networks	This paper discusses multi-input multi-output (MIMO) two-way relay networks that use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. These networks involve two end users exchanging information through a relay in two phases. The relay amplifies and broadcasts signals in the second phase, reducing the time needed for information exchange compared to traditional one-way relay networks. The paper proposes an iterative algorithm for each end user to jointly estimate channel information and detect transmitted data. This involves estimating composite channels and noise covariance matrices resulting from the relay's amplification. The Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm is used for this estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs similarly to having perfect channel information. 
412160	41216099	Doubly Iterative Receiver for MIMO Amplify-And-Forward Relay Networks	This paper discusses a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) wireless relay network consisting of a source, destination, and relay terminal. The transmission from the source to the destination is divided into two phases, with the relay only amplifying and forwarding signals during Phase II in an Amplify-and-Forward mode. However, this can lead to correlated noise at the destination due to the amplification and forwarding of noise elements at the relay. To overcome this, the paper proposes a doubly iterative receiver using an Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm to estimate channel coefficients and decode transmitted signals. Simulation results demonstrate a high performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). 
412160	412160160	A joint channel estimation and data detection receiver for multiuser MIMO IFDMA systems	This paper focuses on the problem of joint channel estimation and data detection for MIMO-IFDMA systems. While IFDMA eliminates MAI, it still suffers from ISI. MIMO-IFDMA systems also face ISI and MSI. The BI-GDFE is an effective interference cancelation scheme that requires CSI. To address this, the paper proposes an EM-based algorithm that uses soft estimates from the BI-GDFE to estimate the channel. This results in a joint channel estimation and data detection receiver. The CRLB is derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulations show that it can achieve BER performance similar to the BI-GDFE with perfect CSI.

The approach used is a service-oriented one, where data is encapsulated in services. The system also supports direct querying of data through an XML-based query language. The research covers topics such as infrastructure support for mobile peers and context-dependent communities, metadata management for services and peers, efficient routing of path queries on hierarchical data, and querying using the AXML language which includes service calls within XML documents.
412161	412161109	A Clustered Index Approach to Distributed XPath Processing	Supporting top-k queries over distributed collections of schemaless XML data is a challenging task due to the lack of schema knowledge in autonomous and dynamic systems. This necessitates the need for approximate query processing. Additionally, fetching top-k results incurs high communication and processing costs as they need to be retrieved and ranked from multiple sources. To address these issues, a clustered path index approach is proposed where data is grouped based on structural information. The query is gradually generalized using structural transformations, and results are ranked based on edit distance between path expressions. A compact indexing data structure is used to reduce index construction cost. Experimental results show that this approach significantly reduces communication cost and maintains a low index construction cost.
412161	41216120	Content-Based Routing of Path Queries in Peer-to-Peer Systems	P2P systems are becoming popular for sharing data among autonomous nodes. This paper focuses on P2P systems that store XML documents and proposes a decentralized approach to routing path queries using specialized data structures, called multi-level Bloom filters. These filters maintain information about the document structure and allow for efficient update propagation. The paper also suggests clustering nodes with similar content to create a hierarchical organization, which improves the recall of retrieved documents. Experimental results show that multi-level Bloom filters are more effective in routing path queries compared to classical Bloom filters. Overall, this approach offers a scalable and efficient solution for sharing XML documents in P2P systems.

To address this issue, a framework is proposed to create a decision support system that unifies and expedites access to DM expertise. It is noted that many DM activities are similar across different types of disasters, and an ontology is suggested as a way to describe these activities and their outcomes. This ontology will serve as a representation of DM expertise and allow for the development of a DM decision support system that can combine and match different activities based on the specific disaster at hand. 
412163	41216314	Model-driven disaster management.	Disaster management involves dealing with a wide range of dynamic factors, making it difficult to model effectively.

412166	41216617	Robust Higher Order Potentials for Enforcing Label Consistency	The paper introduces a new framework for labelling problems that combines multiple segmentations using higher order conditional random fields. This method uses potentials defined on pixel sets generated by unsupervised segmentation algorithms to enforce label consistency in image regions. The framework utilizes the Robust P n model, which is more general than the commonly used P n Potts model, and optimal swap and expansion moves can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This allows for the use of powerful graph cut algorithms for inference.

For a subset of these potentials, the optimal move can be found by solving an st-mincut problem, referred to as the P-n Potts model. This allows for the use of efficient move making algorithms, such as alpha-expansion and alpha beta-swap, for minimizing energy functions involving higher order cliques. These functions are useful for modeling natural scenes and have applications in computer vision, as demonstrated in the paper's example of texture-based video segmentation.

This is particularly relevant for class-based image segmentation, where labels are assigned to pixels from a set of object classes. Previous approaches have attempted to incorporate global object co-occurrence statistics, but have been limited by computational complexity. The proposed model shows a significant improvement in labeling accuracy compared to a pairwise model, especially as the number of labels increases.
412167	41216716	AC: composable asynchronous IO for native languages	The paper discusses AC, a set of language constructs that allow for composable asynchronous IO in native languages like C and C++. This approach allows for multiple IO requests to be issued by a single thread and for long-latency operations to overlap with computation. Unlike traditional asynchronous IO interfaces, AC maintains a sequential programming style without requiring multiple threads or chains of callbacks. The language includes an "async" statement for concurrent IO operations, a "do..finish" block for waiting until async work is complete, and a "cancel" statement for cancelling unfinished IO. The paper provides an operational semantics for the language and evaluates its performance on the Barrelfish research OS and Microsoft Windows. Results show that AC offers comparable performance to existing interfaces while providing a simpler programming model.

The system also detects any attempts to reveal the speculation at runtime. The approach is implemented using GHC 6.6 and tested on 20 programs from the 'nofib' benchmark suite. Results show varying levels of parallelism, with potential speed-ups ranging from 2x to 32x. On a 4-core processor, speed-ups of 10-80% were achieved on 7 programs. This approach is meant to supplement manual parallelization rather than replace it.

It argues that the strictness of the x86 model compared to language level memory models requires certain behaviors to be disallowed in order for a practical STM design to be implemented. The article presents a design for an STM that prevents races between transactional reads and non-transactional writes. It also demonstrates the use of this STM in eliding legacy locks in x86 binaries, allowing for the application of STM without prior awareness or restrictions on source language or compiler. This is exemplified by a multiplayer game that uses STM with minimal changes and a low overhead compared to language level transactional memory.

To improve the accuracy of these systems, the authors propose three modifications to the training data: re-structuring the syntactic structure of training parse trees, re-labeling bracket labels, and re-aligning word alignments across sentences. These modifications are implemented using the EM algorithm and have shown to lead to an overall 1.48 BLEU improvement on the NIST08 evaluation set in Chinese/English translation.

412168	41216870	Translation with Scarce Bilingual Resources	Machine translation of human languages has been around since the beginning of computers. Recent approaches focus on using online text corpora, particularly human-translated documents, to automatically or semi-automatically learn translation knowledge. This works well for some language pairs with ample resources, but for most pairs, there is a lack of data and current techniques are not effective. To understand the differences between human and machine translators, an experiment was conducted where humans were asked to translate an unknown language into English based on a small bilingual text. The participants did well and revealed useful strategies, which were then applied to a statistical translation system.
412169	41216956	Locating causes of program failures	Software failures can be caused by various defects in the program. To identify the specific defect that leads to a failure, programmers compare the program states of a failing run and a successful run. However, these state differences can occur anywhere in the program run, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. To address this issue, programmers focus on the relevant variables and values that are associated with the failure, as well as the moments where these variables undergo transitions. This method has been found to be twice as effective in locating the defect compared to previous methods. For example, if the variable argc was initially 3, and at shell_sort(), variable [2] was 0, this would lead to a program failure.
412169	41216978	Sambamba: a runtime system for online adaptive parallelization	To efficiently utilize a microprocessor, the "classic" approach is to optimize a program at compile-time for all potential uses. However, further optimization can be achieved by anticipating the actual usage profile. The Sambamba project implements a runtime system that allows for adaptive and speculative transformations, rather than just anticipation. This is demonstrated through the automatic parallelization of a small C program, which adapts to the availability of idle system resources and results in a 1.92 fold speedup on two cores without oversubscribing the system. This approach allows for more efficient use of the microprocessor and better performance.
412169	412169103	Debugging debugging: acm sigsoft impact paper award keynote	The abstract of the paper "Yesterday, my program worked. Today, it does not. Why?" discusses the concept of delta debugging, a popular automated debugging technique introduced in a paper published at ESEC/FSE 1999. This year, the paper has received the ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award for its significant influence over the past ten years. In the keynote, the speaker reviews the evolution of debugging and the challenges of simplifying it. They also discuss the needs of programmers and the role of research in addressing those needs.
412170	41217016	Iterative criteria-based approach to engineering the requirements of software development methodologies	Software engineering involves developing and designing software based on the requirements of the target software. Similarly, engineering a software development methodology (SDM) also requires identifying the requirements of the target methodology. The authors propose an iterative method for eliciting and specifying the requirements of a SDM by using existing methodologies as supplementary resources. This method is part of a larger methodology engineering process aimed at designing and implementing a target methodology. The initial set of requirements is identified through analyzing the development situation and refining them through iterative application to relevant methodologies. The final set of requirements is based on the qualities desired in the target methodology, using knowledge gained from existing methodologies. This approach results in a more complete and rigorous set of requirements for the target methodology. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in identifying the requirements of a general object-oriented SDM. 
412170	41217028	1st international workshop on combining modelling and search-based software engineering (CMSBSE 2013)	Modelling is an important aspect of software engineering, allowing for the development of intricate systems. Search-based software engineering (SBSE) is a successful method that utilizes automated discovery to find optimal solutions for software engineering problems. This workshop aims to showcase the potential of combining SBSE and modelling, as they have complementary concepts and techniques. It will provide a platform for researchers to share their ideas and advancements in this field, promoting collaboration and growth within the community. Ultimately, this workshop hopes to further enhance the effectiveness and productivity of software engineering through the integration of SBSE and modelling.
412170	41217038	Constraint programming for type inference in flexible model-driven engineering.	Domain experts have a deep understanding of their field, but can struggle with the technical aspects of model-driven engineering (MDE). Flexible or bottom-up MDE uses simple drawing tools to involve domain experts and allows for the creation of example models at the beginning of the process. However, this can lead to untyped nodes in the models, limiting their reusability. To address this issue, a novel approach that uses Constraint Programming to infer the types of untyped model elements is proposed. This approach significantly reduces the effort needed for completing missing types, with a reduction of up to 91.45%. The approach is evaluated with a number of example models to demonstrate its effectiveness.
412171	4121713	A conditional neural fields model for protein threading.	Alignment errors are a major issue in current protein modeling methods, particularly for proteins with low sequence identity. A new method, called CNFpred, has been developed to improve the accuracy of sequence-template alignment. It uses a probabilistic graphical model called a Conditional Neural Field (CNF) and a non-linear scoring function that considers various protein sequence and structure features. This method has been trained using a quality-sensitive approach, resulting in improved alignments compared to traditional methods. CNFpred performs well on both small and large datasets, and is especially effective for proteins with sparse sequence profiles. This approach can also be applied to protein sequence alignment. 
412171	41217135	Fragment-free approach to protein folding using conditional neural fields.	Protein folding is a crucial process in understanding the structure and function of proteins. However, one of the main challenges in this area is finding an effective way to generate native-like conformations quickly. The popular fragment assembly method, which uses short structural fragments from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), may not always produce accurate results due to the limited availability of fragments and the discrete nature of their combinations. A previous method, known as conditional random fields (CRF), showed promise in generating conformations without relying on fragments but was limited by its ability to incorporate protein sequence information. A new approach, called conditional neural fields (CNF), overcomes this limitation and allows for more accurate modeling of the sequence-structure relationship. When combined with an energy function and Monte Carlo simulation, this CNF method outperformed the CRF method in producing native-like conformations for a variety of test proteins, including one with a previously unknown fold.
412171	41217158	Protein threading using residue co-variation and deep learning.	Template-based modeling, such as homology modeling and protein threading, is a widely used method for predicting protein 3D structures. However, generating alignments and selecting templates for protein sequences with no close templates is a difficult task. A new method, called DeepThreader, has been developed to improve protein threading by using deep learning and residue co-variation information. This method uses deep learning to predict inter-residue distance distribution and then integrates this information with sequential features to build sequence-template alignments through an ADMM algorithm. Experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms popular methods for homology modeling and threading, especially for protein sequences without close templates.
412172	4121725	Establishing an Informed S-BPM Community.	Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) is a new approach to modeling and executing business processes that involves a shift from traditional functional flow-oriented methods. This paradigmatic shift requires organization designers and developers to change their mindset from thinking in terms of functions to thinking in terms of actor interactions. To facilitate this change, a Community of Practice based on education is proposed as an initiative to trigger a shift towards S-BPM. By revisiting traditional methods and experiencing alternatives, this approach aims to effectively implement S-BPM in organizations.
412172	41217225	Towards intuitive modeling of business processes: prospects for flow- and natural-language orientation	In order to effectively adapt to changes, stakeholders should develop a common understanding of business processes by using a "business-process language". This language should be intuitive and closely match the users' mental representations. In an empirical study, individuals who were not familiar with business-process modeling were introduced to the concept and asked to model a scenario using a notation with open semantics. The majority of participants showed a flow-oriented understanding of modeling, with some also displaying a natural language orientation. The results suggest the need for modeling techniques and tools to support organizational development and minimize individual cognitive workload when sharing process knowledge during change processes.
412172	41217221	Whom to talk to? A stakeholder perspective on business process development	This paper discusses the importance of having skilled members who can specify and develop business processes in order to establish agile enterprises. It introduces a language and tool called Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) that allows individual members to contribute to process specifications using natural language constructs and communication patterns. The paper also revisits existing process modelling approaches and suggests ways to incorporate natural language constructs and sentence syntax. This allows organizations to benefit from stakeholder inputs and re-use existing specifications for effective business process engineering. By incorporating S-BPM, organizations can better cope with strategic and operational challenges and improve their overall process management.
412173	4121731	Not Just An Empty Threat: Subgame-Perfect Equilibrium In Repeated Games Played By Computationally Bounded Players	This article discusses the problem of finding subgame-perfect equilibria in repeated games. Previous research has shown that finding a Nash equilibrium in these games is efficient if players are computationally bounded, but becomes extremely difficult if this assumption is removed. However, Nash equilibrium is considered a weak solution concept for extensive-form games. This study introduces a new notion of subgame-perfect equilibrium for computationally bounded players and demonstrates an efficient method for finding such equilibria in repeated games, assuming standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. Additionally, the algorithm can be applied to games with a finite number of players and constant-degree graphical games. 
412173	41217339	On the Non-Existence of Nash Equilibrium in Games with Resource-Bounded Players	The author discusses the concept of sequences of games where the same set of players participate in each game. These sequences can be found in various scenarios such as analyzing player running times, electronic money systems, and cryptographic protocols. Assuming the existence of one-way functions, the author proves that there is a sequence of 2-player zero-sum Bayesian games with polynomial action sizes and utility functions, but no polynomial-time Nash equilibrium. This demonstrates the limitations of traditional game theory concepts in scenarios where players have limited computational resources. The author also shows that Nash equilibrium may not exist when players are constrained to a certain number of computational steps. These examples highlight the potential for a "computational arms race" and the need for alternative equilibrium concepts in competitive settings.
412173	41217328	Game Theory with Costly Computation	Our study introduces a new game-theoretic framework that allows us to analyze strategic agents who may incur costs when making decisions. This framework challenges traditional game-theoretic results, but it provides insights into the behavior observed in well-known games like the prisoner's dilemma and rock-paper-scissors. Additionally, we identify conditions that guarantee the existence of equilibria in these games. We also explore the implementation of mediators in computational games and show that it is related to a variant of traditional cryptographic protocol security. This suggests a connection between the approaches used for handling deviating players in game theory and cryptography.
412174	41217443	Quantifying paedophile activity in a large P2P system	The presence of paedophile activity on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems is a major concern for society, as it has significant implications for child protection, policy making, and internet regulation. However, due to limited traces and analysis methods, current knowledge of this activity is limited. To address this, researchers focused on the eDonkey P2P system and collected millions of keyword-based queries. They developed a tool to detect paedophile queries and established its accuracy through expert assessment. Using this tool, they estimated that 0.25% of all queries on eDonkey are paedophile in nature, and that over 0.2% of users enter such queries. These are the most precise and reliable statistics on this issue to date. 
412174	41217425	Outskewer: Using Skewness to Spot Outliers in Samples and Time Series	Outlier detection in datasets is an important problem for social network analysis, but current methods often rely on assumptions that are not realistic. A new approach called Out skewer is proposed, based on the concept of skewness and how it changes when extreme values are removed. This method is easy to implement, does not require prior knowledge, and can be used in real-time. It has been tested on two datasets, one related to internet topology and the other on search engine queries, and has shown good performance. 
412174	41217435	Clustering in p2p exchanges and consequences on performances	This article presents an analysis of a comprehensive dataset from an eDonkey system, focusing on the correlation between data exchanged by peers who have shared or requested at least one common piece of data. The authors introduce a method for capturing these correlations, called data clustering, and examine it in depth. They then use this method to group data into clusters and show how it affects search in P2P systems. The results are also used to evaluate a previously proposed model, providing realistic parameter values and potential enhancements. This study provides insight into the structure and efficiency of P2P systems. 
412175	4121758	StarT-Voyager: A Flexible Platform for Exploring Scalable SMP Issues	StarT-Voyager is a machine used for research in cluster system communication. It consists of a network interface unit (NIU) that connects a PowerPC-based SMP to the MIT Arctic network. The NIU is highly flexible, with its functions easily modifiable through firmware or programmable hardware. This allows for comparison of different communication interfaces and strategies. The NIU has a fast embedded processor and large FPGAs, making it efficient and able to perform primitive operations in hardware to reduce firmware overhead. It currently supports four forms of message passing, S-COMA, and NUMA shared memory, but can be reconfigured to introduce new mechanisms for better usability and performance.
412175	41217528	A general technique for deterministic model-cycle-level debugging	Efficient use of FPGA resources requires implementing complex hardware models in multiple implementation cycles, which may not have a simple relationship with model cycles. This makes it challenging to debug and reconstruct the state of the synchronous system. A good debugging facility should provide control over the target design, easy access to significant state information, and deterministic execution for multicore processors. The paper presents a debugging technique based on LI-BDN theory, which enables deterministic model-cycle-level debugging. This technique was used to develop the debugging infrastructure for Arete, an FPGA-based multicore simulator, with minimal resource and performance penalties. The debugging infrastructure in Arete has only 5% area and 6% performance overheads.
412175	41217573	H.264 Decoder: A Case Study in Multiple Design Points	H.264 is a popular video compression standard used in various products like cell phones and HDTV. However, due to different performance, power, and cost requirements, different hardware and software solutions are necessary for decoding H.264. To address this issue, a design methodology and tools were developed to support synthesis from high-level descriptions and allow modular refinement throughout the design process. Using Bluespec SystemVerilog, various designs for the H.264 decoder were created to support decoding at different resolutions. The design methodology can also be applied to other IP blocks and allows for quick exploration and changes in the design process. Additionally, the paper discusses common design issues related to memory structures.
412176	4121766	Approximation Algorithms for MAX SAT: Yannakakis vs. Goemans-Williamson	MAX SAT, also known as the maximum satisfiability problem, is a problem where the goal is to find a truth assignment that satisfies the largest number of clauses, each with assigned weights. This paper discusses approximation algorithms for MAX SAT proposed by Yannakakis and Goemans-Williamson. The authors present an improved algorithm based on Yannakakis' original algorithm. While Yannakakis' algorithm has the same performance guarantee as Goemans-Williamson, the improved algorithm has a better performance guarantee and can achieve a 0.770-approximation. This shows that the improved algorithm is more efficient in finding a near-optimal solution for MAX SAT.
412176	41217677	Approximation Algorithms for the Maximum Satisfiability Problem	The maximum satisfiability problem (MAX SAT) involves finding a truth assignment that maximizes the sum of the weights of satisfied clauses. This paper presents approximation algorithms for MAX SAT, with a 0.76544-approximation algorithm being the best proposed. The previous best algorithm, by Goemans-Williamson, had a performance guarantee of 0.7584. The new algorithms are based on semidefinite programming and the 0.75-approximation algorithms of Yannakakis and Goemans-Williamson.
412176	4121760	An Approximation Algorithm for MAX 3-SAT	This paper introduces a new algorithm that can approximate MAX 3-SAT with a ratio of 0.80, which is a slight improvement from the previously known 0.75 or 0.755 ratios for MAX SAT. This algorithm is significant because it addresses the NP-completeness of approximating MAX 3-SAT within a ratio of 112/113. The results show that the best approximation ratio for MAX 3-SAT lies between 0.80 and 112/113. 
412177	41217792	A SIMD optimization framework for retargetable compilers	Retargetable C compilers are commonly used for new embedded processors and to explore processor architecture. However, this approach often results in lower code quality compared to hand-written compilers or assembly code due to a lack of dedicated optimization techniques. To address this issue, flexible and retargetable code optimization techniques can be designed specifically for a range of target architectures. This article focuses on optimizing SIMD instruction support, which is common in embedded processors for multimedia applications but can be challenging due to nonuniform architectures and limitations on data types and memory alignment. The article presents an efficient and quickly retargetable SIMD code optimization framework integrated into an industrial retargetable C compiler. Experimental results show significant improvements in code quality for various processors, approaching the theoretical limit. 
412177	41217714	Graph-based code selection techniques for embedded processors	Code selection is a crucial step in the process of generating code for programmable processors. It involves finding the most efficient way to convert machine-independent intermediate code into processor-specific machine instructions. While traditional approaches to code selection work well for general-purpose processors, they may not be suitable for embedded processors due to their unique architectural features. This paper presents two techniques for code selection in embedded processors: one for media processors with SIMD instructions and another for fixed-point DSPs with irregular data paths. These techniques prioritize code quality over compilation speed and utilize data-flow graphs instead of data-flow trees. The use of graph-based code selection allows for better utilization of certain architectural features and results in significantly higher code quality in some cases. 
412177	412177111	Compiler based exploration of DSP energy savings by SIMD operations	The increasing use of digital signal processors (DSPs) in embedded systems requires optimizing compilers that support their unique architecture features. This includes utilizing single instruction multiple data (SIMD) functionality to improve performance. However, optimizing both hardware and software is crucial for creating an energy-efficient system. While SIMD operations may seem like a potential energy-saving solution, it is not guaranteed as each operation may use the same amount of energy as sequential operations. This paper explores the energy-saving potential of SIMD operations for DSPs, using a compilation framework with an integrated energy cost model. Results from various benchmarks and an MP3 application demonstrate the impact of SIMD operations on energy consumption.
412178	41217865	Joint Multiple Target Tracking and Classification Using Controlled Based Cheap JPDA-Multiple Model Particle Filter in Cluttered Environment	This paper addresses the challenge of tracking and classifying multiple targets in a cluttered environment. The approach involves using a multiple model particle filter (MMPF) to handle nonlinear filtering with switching dynamic models. Joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) is also utilized to determine the origin of measurements. The efficiency of using Fitzgerald's Cheap JPDA is proven in the literature. Additionally, a controller based on the quality of innovation is implemented to adjust the number of particles. Monte Carlo simulations with two maneuvering targets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. 
412178	41217819	Evidential Data Association Filter	Multi-target tracking in cluttered environments is a difficult problem due to challenges in associating measurements with tracks and estimating the targets' states. Various approaches have been suggested, with the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) and its modified versions being commonly used. This paper proposes the use of belief functions to address both the measurement-to-track association and estimation problems. The method utilizes a Bayesian approach to assign basic belief mass and makes decisions based on an extension of the frame of hypotheses. Testing on a nearly constant velocity target showed improved performance compared to the nearest neighbor filter and JPDA filter in highly ambiguous cases. This suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
412178	41217837	A modified fuzzy clustering for documents retrieval: application to document categorization	The paper introduces a new fuzzy-based clustering algorithm for document categorization. Each document is represented as a fuzzy set and the algorithm is constrained to cluster these fuzzy sets. A metric measure called Bhattacharyya distance is used to detect overlapping between documents and cluster prototypes. This allows for the introduction of fuzziness in document clustering, allowing a document to belong to multiple categories. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through a case study in the construction sector.
412179	41217916	Jgroup-ARM: a distributed object group platform with autonomous replication management	This paper discusses Jgroup-ARM, a distributed object group platform that uses a measurement-based assessment technique to ensure its fault-handling capability. Jgroup is built on top of Java RMI and is designed for use in partitionable systems. ARM aims to improve system dependability through a fault-treatment mechanism and focuses on deployment and operational aspects. The combination of Jgroup and ARM makes it easier to develop, deploy, and manage partition-aware applications. The paper presents experimental results that demonstrate Jgroup-ARM's ability to recover applications to their initial state in various failure scenarios, including multiple network partitions. 
412179	4121797	Application-based dynamic primary views in asynchronous distributed systems	The paper discusses programming network applications using the process group paradigm and the challenges that arise when these applications are deployed in unreliable networks. These challenges include the possibility of the application partitioning into disconnected clusters, resulting in multiple views of the group's composition. The paper proposes a mechanism for efficiently determining the "primary partition" for the group, which allows for the selection rules to be modified at runtime and supports dynamic groups with changing membership. Additionally, this mechanism allows for the re-establishment of a primary partition even after a total failure scenario. These features enable the development of partition-aware applications that can adapt to their operating environment by using observed execution characteristics to establish selection rules.
412179	41217927	T-Man: gossip-based overlay topology management	Overlay topology is crucial in P2P systems, as it helps with functions like routing, searching, and information dissemination, and affects their efficiency, cost, and stability. The structure of nodes in the system can also be seen as a topology, and a new protocol called T-MAN is proposed to construct and maintain various topologies. This protocol uses a ranking function to define the topology, allowing nodes to choose their neighbors based on preference. This simple concept allows for easy control and flexibility in the self-organization process of topologies. The T-MAN protocol is efficient and robust in dynamic environments and can be used as a standalone solution or as a component for other protocols.
412180	41218063	Weakening the language bias in LINUS	Propositional inductive learning algorithms have limitations in their ability to incorporate background knowledge and the expressiveness of their knowledge representation. This paper proposes a solution in the form of LINUS, a system that utilizes a more expressive logic programming framework to effectively incorporate background knowledge in learning both propositional and relational descriptions. This allows for the learning of logic programs in the form of constrained deductive hierarchical database clauses and determinate deductive database clauses. This method bridges the gap between propositional learning and more complex knowledge representation, leading to improved learning capabilities.
412180	41218038	The utility of background knowledge in learning medical diagnostic rules	Inductive learning algorithms are commonly used in the medical field to learn diagnostic rules. However, they are limited by the use of a restricted attribute-value language. To overcome this, the inductive learning system LINUS incorporates these learners into a more powerful logic programming framework, allowing for the effective use of background knowledge. This was applied to the early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases, where LINUS was given background knowledge from a medical specialist. Evaluation of the induced rules using the CN2 learner and measurements of their performance showed that the use of background knowledge greatly improved the quality of the rules.
412180	41218034	Learning in Clausal Logic: A Perspective on Inductive Logic Programming	Inductive logic programming is a type of machine learning that uses clausal logic to learn from examples. One of the earliest systems was Ehud Shapiro's Model Inference System, which could generate simple recursive programs. Many techniques from this system, such as top-down search and the use of background knowledge, are still used today. However, there have been advancements in handling noisy data, efficient search methods, and using logical representations beyond definite clauses. Some researchers are exploring alternatives to Prolog, while others are studying learning tasks that involve different types of hypotheses. This chapter provides an overview of these topics and discusses current research directions influenced by data mining and real-world applications.
412181	41218114	Using DEMO to Identify IT Services	IT Service Management (ITSM) has become increasingly important as organizations invest in their Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure and customers become more demanding. The Service Catalog is a crucial element of ITSM, formally documenting the available services provided by IT organizations. However, accurately identifying these services can be challenging and can have serious consequences if done incorrectly. This paper proposes a method using the Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO) to identify IT services. The Design Science Research Methodology and customer feedback were used to evaluate the method, showing that the new services list was preferred by customers compared to the previous one. This highlights the importance of accurately identifying IT services to meet customer demands and improve service quality.
412181	41218113	IT Governance Patterns in the Portuguese Financial Industry	IT has been used in large organizations since the 1950s for internal and external purposes. However, the widespread use of technology has led to a critical dependence on IT, requiring a specific focus on IT Governance (ITG). Determining the right ITG mechanisms can be complex, and this paper suggests an exploratory research approach using case studies and interviews with Portuguese financial services organizations to identify common patterns. The goal is to create theories and recommendations for ITG mechanisms that are suitable for different contexts. The research methodology used is Design Science Research (DSR). The paper concludes with limitations, contributions, and suggestions for future work. 
412181	41218143	Using People-CMM for Diminishing Resistance to ITIL	The role of Information Technology (IT) has become crucial in most organizations, leading to a higher demand and tighter control on IT departments. To meet these requirements, IT departments have been implementing Service Management frameworks, with ITIL being the most popular. However, many ITIL projects fail due to organizational resistance. This research aims to test the hypothesis that using best practices from the People Capability Maturity Model (People-CMM) can improve organizational maturity and consequently lead to greater ITIL maturity. Three real-world case studies were conducted, and while the hypothesis cannot be rejected, more research is needed to establish a cause-effect relationship between People-CMM and ITIL.
412182	41218218	Fat-trees: Universal networks for hardware-efficient supercomputing	The author introduces fat-trees, a new type of universal routing network that can connect processors in a parallel supercomputer. These networks can be customized to support varying levels of communication, allowing for efficient use of hardware and potential cost savings for applications like finite-element analysis. The author proves that fat-trees are the most optimal routing network of a given size and demonstrates this using a VLSI model that considers wiring as a direct cost. It is also shown that a fat-tree built from a specific amount of hardware can simulate any other network built from the same amount of hardware with only a slightly longer time (polylogarithmic factor greater).
412182	41218246	A hyperconcentrator switch for routing bit-serial messages	The article discusses a VLSI chip designed for highly parallel message routing networks. The chip can quickly concentrate bit-serial messages onto fewer wires, using ratioed nMOS and large fan-in NOR gates. It has a regular layout and incurs only 2 lg n gate delays. The design can be adapted for different technologies and has applications beyond message concentration, such as providing fault tolerance and being used in a processor datapath for various bit manipulations. Multiple hyperconcentrator switches can also be combined to create a larger partial concentrator switch.
412182	4121821	Space-Efficient Scheduling of Multithreaded Computations	In this paper, the authors address the issue of scheduling parallel computations in a way that achieves linear speedup without significantly increasing the space required per processor. They introduce a new model for multithreaded computation and use three measures to quantify execution efficiency. The first result shows that some computations cannot achieve both time and space efficiency simultaneously. However, for strict computations where all arguments must be available before a procedure can be invoked, a simple online algorithm can be used to compute a schedule that is both time and space efficient. To reduce overhead costs, a decentralized algorithm is proposed that can compute and execute a P-processor schedule with expected time and space complexities of $O(T_1/P + T_\infty\lg P)$ and $O(S_1P\lg P)$, respectively.
412183	41218373	Drift-free tracking of rigid and articulated objects	Model-based 3D trackers are used to estimate the position, rotation, and joint angles of a model from video data. However, they often suffer from drift due to small errors accumulating over time. This is especially problematic for human motion capture and tracking when there are multiple moving objects and occlusions present. To address this issue, the authors propose an analysis-by-synthesis framework that combines patch-based and region-based matching to track both structured and homogeneous body parts. The method is demonstrated to work well for various scenarios, including fast movements, self-occlusions, and clutter. The study also includes a quantitative error analysis and comparison with other model-based approaches.
412183	41218345	Global Consistency Priors for Joint Part-Based Object Tracking and Image Segmentation	This paper discusses the use of Deformable Parts Models (DPMs) to enhance the tracking performance of previously unseen, articulated objects. The DPM is extended with global priors to incorporate foreground/background segmentation cues, and a Dual Decomposition approach is proposed to efficiently solve high-order constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated on the VOT online tracking benchmark and outperforms the baseline in accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the concept of part visibility is introduced to improve the flexibility of a generic DPM generated from a single reference frame, resulting in the visibility-aware DPM (VDPM). This allows for fine-grained articulated object tracking using an automatically generated DPM from a single template image.
412183	412183128	Learning for multi-view 3d tracking in the context of particle filters	This paper presents a method for integrating prior knowledge into the particle filter framework for 3D tracking. The approach involves learning the probability of an object's states, including correlations between state parameters, from training samples. This knowledge is then incorporated into the particle filter, specifically the annealed particle filter scheme. The method is also shown to work with a variational model for image segmentation, which does not rely on background subtraction. Experiments using a four camera set-up for tracking a human body show improved accuracy and robustness to image distortions. The results are compared to an industrial marker-based tracking system.
412184	41218437	Routing for energy minimization in the speed scaling model	Network optimization aims to minimize energy consumption in telecommunication networks by adjusting the processing speed of network elements according to the amount of traffic they carry. Existing research on this topic focuses on individual elements, but we aim to optimize the entire network. We specifically examine routing with the goal of providing guaranteed speed/bandwidth for a given demand while minimizing energy use. The energy curve, which shows how energy is consumed as processing speed increases, plays a crucial role in determining the optimal routes. We show that for certain energy curves, there is a constant approximation for routing, but for others with a non-zero startup cost, there is no feasible constant approximation. However, we present two other approximations that provide good results. 
412184	41218433	Source Routing and Scheduling in Packet Networks	The study of routing and scheduling in packet-switched networks involves finding a set of paths for packets that does not overload any links in the network. An online routing algorithm has been developed that can find these admissible paths in real-time. The algorithm calculates the shortest path for each packet based on the current congestion of links. A scheduling protocol has also been developed that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every packet, which is an improvement from previous protocols. The choice of paths can also affect the stability of scheduling protocols, with some protocols remaining unstable regardless of path choice. However, intelligent path selection can make a difference, as seen in the case of a ring network with parallel links. 
412184	41218460	General Dynamic Routing with Per-Packet Delay Guarantees of O(Distance + 1/Session Rate)	Modern communication networks face the challenge of providing performance guarantees, especially for real-time traffic like voice and video. The main concern is to control the delay experienced by packets from source to destination. In connection-oriented packet-switching networks with multiple sessions, only one packet can advance on an edge at a time due to limited bandwidth. The goal is to schedule sessions at each switch to minimize worst-case packet delay and queue buildup. This study presents a periodic schedule that achieves a delay bound of O(1/ri+di) and is asymptotically optimal for periodic schedules. A distributed algorithm is also proposed for delivering packets within O(1/ri+di\log(m/rmin)) steps. These results can be extended to handle bursty traffic with a burst size constraint. 
412185	41218524	Learning collaboration strategies for committees of learning agents	In multi-agent systems, it is important for agents to decide when and with whom to cooperate. This paper focuses on systems with learning agents, whose goal is to accurately predict solutions to problems. Each agent must determine whether to solve a problem alone or collaborate with other agents. The paper presents a proactive learning approach that allows agents to learn when to form committees and which agents to invite. Experiments show that this results in smaller committees with maintained or improved problem solving accuracy compared to committees composed of all agents. This approach is beneficial for efficient collaboration in multi-agent systems.
412185	41218534	An Ensemble Architecture for Learning Complex Problem-Solving Techniques from Demonstration	The "Generalized Integrated Learning Architecture" (GILA) is a new approach to learning and problem solving that utilizes a set of independent learning and reasoning components coordinated by a central executive. Each component learns from a small number of expert demonstrations and during performance, proposes solutions to subproblems that are then pieced together by the executive. This heterogeneity in the components allows for more effective learning and problem solving. The effectiveness of GILA is demonstrated in the domain of airspace management, where it performs as well as or better than humans and outperforms individual components. This highlights the power of the ensemble architecture for learning and problem solving.
412185	41218543	Using Meta-reasoning to Improve the Performance of Case-Based Planning	In this paper, a new meta-reasoning approach is proposed for improving the performance of Case-based planning (CBP) systems in real-time domains. The approach utilizes failure patterns to identify anomalous behaviors and learns from experience which failures should be addressed. It also incorporates both successful and failed executions for meta-reasoning. The approach is evaluated through a system called Meta-Darmok in a real-time strategy game, which shows successful adaptation and improved performance through revisions of the case base. This highlights the effectiveness of using meta-reasoning in CBP systems and its potential for autonomous performance improvement.

The set G3(n, g) includes all triconnected rooted plane graphs with n vertices and inner faces of size at most g. This paper presents an algorithm for listing all plane graphs in G3(n, g). The algorithm takes constant time per output and outputs the difference from the previous output.
412186	41218682	Constant time generation of biconnected rooted plane graphs	A plane graph is a drawing of a planar graph without any intersecting edges. In a rooted plane graph, an outer edge is designated as the root. An algorithm has been developed to efficiently list all plane graphs with n vertices, using a constant amount of time and space. This algorithm only generates plane graphs where the size of each inner face is less than or equal to a specified number. This algorithm has a time and space complexity of O(n).
412186	41218630	Generation Of Symmetric And Asymmetric Biconnected Rooted Outerplanar Graphs	A rooted graph has a designated root vertex. An outerplanar graph is represented by a plane embedding with all vertices along the outer boundary. Two different embeddings of a rooted outerplanar graph are called symmetric copies. An algorithm has been developed that can generate all biconnected rooted outerplanar graphs with exactly n vertices and inner faces no larger than g, in O(n) space and O(1) time, without producing two symmetric copies of the same graph.
412187	41218743	The asymptotic number of labeled graphs with given degree sequences	The article discusses the number of n × n symmetric non-negative integer matrices subject to certain constraints. These constraints include specified and bounded row sums, bounded entries, and a set of specified zero entries. The article provides asymptotic estimates for this number and relates it to incidence matrices for labeled graphs. This result has potential implications in various fields such as combinatorics and graph theory.
412187	41218718	Locally Restricted Compositions II. General Restrictions and Infinite Matrices.	The study focuses on the compositions of an integer n, where the value of each part is constrained based on previous parts within a fixed distance. These constraints may depend on the index of the part, modulo a fixed integer m. Periodic constraints are naturally seen when compositions are written in a single row. The number of compositions of n is shown to be asymptotically equal to Ar-n, with A and r being constants. The distribution of the counts is expected to follow a joint normal distribution with means vector and covariance matrix proportional to n. The method of proof involves infinite matrices and does not provide accurate estimation methods. The study also examines the longest run, and in some cases, provides almost sure asymptotic estimates for the maximum part and number of distinct parts.
412187	4121879	On the size of PLAs required to realize binary and multiple-valued functions	This content discusses the use of upper and lower bounds to determine the average number of product terms needed for a minimal realization. It also mentions that the variance plays a role in understanding how PLA size affects the set of functions that can be realized. While the bounds are most accurate with few nonzero values, they can still be used to analyze commercially available PLAs. The analysis reveals that the number of nonzero values is a useful factor in determining the likelihood of a function being realized, with only one commercially available PLA being an exception.
412188	41218875	Analysis of human behavior to a communication robot in an open field	This study explores human behavior towards an interactive robot at a science museum. Understanding how people interact with robots is crucial in developing communication robots for everyday use. The researchers analyzed visitor behavior towards a simple interactive robot at the museum, using information from sound level and range sensors. They identified factors that influence how people approach, maintain distance, and physically and verbally interact with the robot. This allowed them to extract useful information from the sensor data and apply it to communication robots. Overall, this research contributes to the development of robots that can predict and optimize their interactions with humans based on their behavior.
412188	41218843	Interactive Humanoid Robots for a Science Museum	 found that the use of RFID tags contributed to a more natural and personalized interaction between visitors and robotsThis paper discusses a field trial using interactive humanoid robots at a science museum to engage visitors in science. Each visitor was given an RFID tag to wear, which allowed the robots to interact with them autonomously through gestures and speech. The robots also performed exhibit guiding by moving around and explaining exhibits based on sensor information. The trial lasted for two months and received positive evaluations from visitors. The use of RFID tags improved the naturalness and personalization of the interactions between visitors and robots.
412188	41218863	An affective guide robot in a shopping mall	A guide robot was developed and tested in a shopping mall to explore the potential tasks that robots could perform in daily life. The robot was designed to interact naturally with customers and provide shopping information. It used RFID tags for person identification and was semi-autonomous, with a human operator controlling it in certain situations. The field trial lasted 25 days and the robot interacted with approximately 100 groups of customers each day. Customer responses from questionnaires showed that 63 out of 235 people actually went shopping based on the information provided by the robot, indicating potential for robots to work effectively in shopping malls.
412189	41218930	Diagonal Unloading Beamforming for Source Localization.	In sensor array beamforming, algorithms are used to estimate the location of a radiating source. Diagonal loading of the beamformer covariance matrix is commonly used to improve accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a new method, called diagonal unloading (DU), which adds an additional constraint to the array output vector's covariance matrix. This regularization is achieved by subtracting a set amount of white noise from the matrix's main diagonal. The DU beamformer aims to separate the signal subspace from the noisy signal space and is calculated by enforcing a negative definite covariance matrix. The proposed DU method is compared to other beamforming methods in terms of computational cost and localization performance. The results show that the DU method is comparable to existing methods, making it a simple, effective, and efficient option for array processing.
412189	4121895	Localization and Tracking of an Acoustic Source using a Diagonal Unloading Beamforming and a Kalman Filter.	This article discusses the signal processing framework and results for the IEEE AASP challenge on acoustic source localization and tracking (LOCATA). The framework is designed for single-source scenarios and consists of four main components: pre-processing, voice activity detection, localization, and tracking. The pre-processing includes the short-time Fourier transform and cross power spectral density matrices estimation. The VAD is calculated using a threshold of the CPSD matrices. The localization uses a low-complexity and high-resolution method called diagonal unloading beamforming, and the DOA estimation is smoothed with a Kalman filter. Results are reported for different microphone arrays, including a 7-microphone linear array, a 12-microphone pseudo-spherical array integrated in a humanoid robot, and a 32-microphone spherical array. 
412189	41218971	Exploiting a Geometrically Sampled Grid in the SRP-PHAT for Localization Improvement and Power Response Sensitivity Analysis.	The steered response power phase transform (SRP-PHAT) is a beamformer method used in acoustic localization applications. It is known for its ability to perform well in reverberant environments. This paper introduces a new spatial grid design procedure called the geometrically sampled grid (GSG). This method takes into account the discrete sampling of time difference of arrival (TDOA) functions and desired spatial resolution to compute the spatial grid. The paper also presents a new SRP-PHAT localization algorithm based on the GSG method. This method uses the intersections of discrete hyperboloids representing TDOA information to project the TDOA information onto the search grid. The GSG method can assist in designing the best search grid for a given sensor array, analyzing the array's sensitivity, and characterizing its spatial localization accuracy. It can also aid in the design process for system developers.
412190	41219047	Can network characteristics detect spam effectively in a stand-alone enterprise?	Prior research has demonstrated that the network dynamics of an email packet and the entire connection can be used to classify the email as spam or not. However, this research has mainly focused on data collected from various sources. In this paper, the authors re-examine these techniques using data from a single enterprise and find that packet properties are not as effective. They also show that incorporating flow characteristics into the model of packet features can improve the accuracy, indicating that some flow features are already captured by the packet features.
412190	41219048	On estimating end-to-end network path properties	Transport protocols rely on accurate information about network conditions to efficiently transfer data. In the context of the Internet, these protocols must make their own estimates based on measurements taken by connection endpoints. There are two main problems in transport estimation: determining the retransmission timer (RTO) for a reliable protocol and estimating available bandwidth for a connection. Using TCP and a large measurement set, we evaluate different algorithms for RTO estimation and find that their minimum values and timer granularity have the biggest impact on performance. We also explore bandwidth estimation techniques and develop a receiver-side algorithm that performs better than previously proposed methods.
412190	41219051	A reactive measurement framework	In this paper, the concept of "measurement" is discussed as a process rather than a one-time event when trying to understand complex network behavior. The authors introduce the idea of reactive measurement (REM), which uses the results of one measurement to automatically determine if additional measurements are needed to gain a better understanding of a phenomenon. While REM has been used in some studies, there has been a lack of examination of its potential and a framework for its use. The authors discuss the power of REM and propose an architecture for a system that can be used by network researchers to facilitate the use of this approach. They argue that REM has the potential to greatly assist in identifying the root causes of network problems and conducting targeted measurements for specific conditions by integrating different measurement tools.
412191	41219152	Parallel non-linear optimization: towards the design of a decision support system for air quality management	Large numerical simulation codes have become increasingly popular for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. In the environmental field, these simulations have been used to predict the outcomes of various scenarios and aid in decision making for strategies that balance financial gain with environmental impact. To optimize these decisions, environmental decision support systems have been developed, using high performance computing to evaluate different policy options and find the best solution. This involves solving non-linear optimization problems with discrete and continuous parameters. In this paper, the authors focus on the optimization component of a decision support system and assess the effectiveness of using the quasi-Newton BFGS method, which can be parallelized for faster computation. Through a case study in air quality management, the authors demonstrate the success of this approach, showing significant performance gains and feasibility for solving real-world problems using parallel and distributed supercomputers.
412191	41219191	Run-time thread sorting to expose data-level parallelism	CQC is a complex method used in quantum chemistry to analyze the electronic structure of molecules. One of its key components, the evaluation of Electron Repulsion Integrals (ERIs), presents a challenge for data parallel processing due to controlflow variation between different evaluations. However, it has been observed that the variation is limited and can be classified into distinct sets, making data parallel execution possible. To achieve this, an architecture with high throughput and small memories is proposed. This approach has been evaluated using FPGA synthesis and has potential for use in other manycore architectures. 
412191	41219119	A Flexible IO Scheme for Grid Workflows	Computational Grids are being seen as the future of computing for solving large-scale problems in various fields such as science, engineering, and commerce. These Grids are used to run a series of independent programs, known as Grid Workflows, in a pipeline. There are different methods of linking these programs, from simple file-based IO to more complex message passing. This paper proposes a flexible IO architecture that allows for various coupling mechanisms to be used in Grid Workflows without modifying the source code or fixing them during design. The performance of this system is evaluated using a computational mechanics workflow. 
412192	41219227	Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Key Generation against Burst Interruption	A distributed key generation scheme distributes a secret key among key servers and computes a corresponding public key. Canny and Sorkin proposed a probabilistic threshold scheme for a large number of key servers with lower communication cost. However, their scheme has some limitations that can be addressed using randomness technique. This paper introduces a secure scheme against dishonest key servers and better performance. Simulation experiments show that their scheme and the proposed scheme can be used in different scenarios.
412192	41219219	Anonymous Password Based Authenticated Key Exchange with Sub-Linear Communication	The paper introduces a new anonymous password-based authenticated key exchange protocol with improved communication cost. The protocol has a sub-linear cost of O(root N), which is better than the previous protocol's cost of O(N), where N is the number of users. The authors also demonstrate the security of the session key against an active adversary in the random oracle model and the anonymity of user identities against a semi-honest adversary in the standard model. Overall, the proposed protocol provides a more efficient and secure way for users to exchange keys anonymously.
412192	41219230	Robust Key-Evolving Public Key Encryption Schemes	In order to address the issue of key exposure in public key encryption schemes, we propose a key-evolving paradigm similar to that used in forward-secure digital signature schemes. This paradigm involves dividing time into periods, where the decryptor holds a specific secret key during each period. The public key remains fixed throughout its lifetime. This allows for the encryption of messages using a specific period's secret key, which can only be decrypted with that key. When the time period changes, the decryptor updates their key and immediately deletes the previous one. This ensures that if one key is compromised, it does not affect the confidentiality of messages encrypted with other keys. We propose two key-evolving public key encryption schemes that are resilient against the compromise of a certain number of private keys. These schemes are proven to be secure against different types of attacks, assuming the DDH problem is hard.
412193	41219318	A container yard storage strategy for improving land utilization and operation efficiency in a transshipment hub port.	This paper discusses the challenges of managing a storage yard in a busy transshipment hub where there are high levels of loading and unloading activities. Due to the large amount of container traffic and limited land availability, efficient services are difficult to provide. A consignment strategy with a static yard template has been used, but it sacrifices land utilization. To address this issue, the paper proposes two space-sharing approaches that dynamically reserve storage space for different vessels during different shifts. This also considers workload balancing to reduce traffic congestion. The proposed framework integrates space reservation and workload assignment, resulting in more efficient container handling and reduced yard crane deployment. Experimental results support the effectiveness of this approach.
412193	41219391	Analysis On High Throughput Layout Of Container Yards	Efficient handling resources are crucial for optimizing container flows at a container terminal. A well-designed layout can greatly improve the performance of handling activities. This study focuses on a design process that maximizes throughput capacity and minimizes resource configuration for two types of parallel yard layouts: double-lane and single-lane. Experiments were conducted to analyze the effects on layout structure and resource configuration. It was found that container flows by vehicles have a greater impact on the design compared to processing times for quay cranes and yard cranes. The single-lane layout is ideal for high throughput capacity, while the double-lane layout is better for efficient vehicle flows.
412193	41219354	Flexible space-sharing strategy for storage yard management in a transshipment hub port	This paper discusses a storage yard planning problem for a transshipment port with limited space and high-throughput levels. The traditional consignment strategy, where containers for the same destination are stored together, is known to be inefficient in space utilization. To address this issue, a new approach called the "flexible space-sharing strategy" is proposed, which allows the same storage location to be reserved for two vessels as long as their containers do not occupy the space at the same time. This strategy is formulated as a mixed integer program and a search algorithm combining MIP and heuristics is developed to find a solution. Numerical experiments show that the flexible strategy can handle more containers within the same space compared to the traditional strategy.
412194	41219473	Slid pairs in the initialisation of the A5/1 stream cipher	A5/1 is a stream cipher used in the GSM system to ensure privacy. It uses a shift register and majority clocking rule for updating its registers. In this study, the initialisation process of A5/1 is analysed. The researchers found that the cipher has a sliding property, where every valid internal state can also be used as a legitimate loaded state. This property allows for multiple key-IV pairs to produce phase shifted keystream sequences. The paper also discusses a possible attack on the cipher based on this property, using only ciphertext.
412194	41219423	Weak key-IV pairs in the A5/1 stream cipher	The A5/1 cipher is a stream cipher used in the GSM system for privacy protection. This paper focuses on the initialisation process of A5/1 and the loading of the secret key and IV. Through analysis, it is shown that there are weak key-IV pairs in A5/1 due to this loading process, which can result in registers containing all-zero values. This can lead to weak keystream sequences and a distinguisher is described that can fully decrypt affected messages in cases where two or three registers contain only zeros. This highlights potential vulnerabilities in the A5/1 cipher and the need for stronger key-IV loading methods.
412194	412194106	State convergence in the initialisation of stream ciphers	The initialisation process is an important aspect of stream cipher design, as it ensures that each key and IV combination produces a unique keystream. However, two ciphers, A5/1 and Mixer, have been found to have state convergence issues, resulting in a limited effective key-space. This paper analyzes these ciphers and explains how the state convergence problem occurs, providing an estimate of the effective key-space for each cipher. This highlights the importance of thorough analysis and testing in the design of secure stream ciphers. 
412195	4121957	Computing loci of rank defects of linear matrices using Gröbner bases and applications to cryptology	The MinRank problem, also known as computing loci of rank defects of linear matrices, is a challenging task in linear algebra with diverse applications in fields such as Cryptology, Error Correcting Codes, and Geometry. This problem involves finding points where the rank of a given square linear matrix is less than a specified integer. The paper aims to develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem by studying two algebraic formulations: one that generates bi-homogeneous equations and another that involves a determinantal ideal. Under certain assumptions, the paper provides new bounds on the degree of regularity of these formulations, allowing for an estimation of the complexity of computing Gröbner bases. The results have practical implications, such as breaking a cryptographic challenge and evaluating the security of a cryptosystem. The determinantal ideal formulation is found to be more suitable for Gröbner bases computations. 
412195	41219527	Critical points and Gröbner bases: the unmixed case	The article discusses the importance of computing critical points of polynomial maps on algebraic varieties, as they are essential for finding the global minimum of the map. These points are relevant in non-convex polynomial optimization, which has many applications in fields such as control theory, chemistry, and economics. Gröbner basis algorithms have been found to be efficient in computing these critical points, leading to the development of software using the Critical Point Method. The article provides complexity estimates for computing Gröbner bases of systems defining critical points, showing that under certain assumptions, the complexity is polynomial in the number of critical points. Experimental evidence supports these theoretical results.
412195	41219551	Polynomial Systems Solving by Fast Linear Algebra	Polynomial system solving is a well-studied problem in mathematics that has many practical applications. Its complexity is a fundamental issue in computer science and can vary depending on the specific context of the problem. In order to find the most general solution, a representation of the solutions is needed that can accurately recover the exact solutions or provide a certified estimate. This representation is typically given by a set of univariate polynomials known as the lexicographical Gr\"obner basis. The current best algorithm for computing this basis has a complexity of $\widetilde{O}(d^{3n})$ operations, where $n$ is the number of variables and $d$ is the maximal degree of the equations. However, a new algorithm has been proposed that can decrease this complexity to $\widetilde{O}(d^{\omega n})$, where $2 \leq \omega < 2.3727$ is the exponent in the complexity of multiplying two dense matrices. This means that for generic or B\'ezout-bound polynomial systems, the complexity of solving can be reduced from $\widetilde{O}(D^3)$ to $\widetilde{O}(D^\omega)$, where $D$ is the number of solutions. This improvement is achieved through the use of new algorithms based on fast linear algebra, with a deterministic algorithm for systems with bounded degree and a randomized algorithm for unbounded degree.
412196	41219686	Spectral Analysis of Quasi-Cyclic Product Codes	In this paper, we analyze a linear quasi-cyclic product code made up of two quasi-cyclic codes with relatively prime lengths over finite fields. We explore the spectral analysis of this code using the spectral analysis of the row and column codes. We also present a new lower bound for the minimum Hamming distance of a given quasi-cyclic code and introduce a new algebraic decoding algorithm. Additionally, we prove the explicit basis of this product code in terms of the generator matrix using a special order form. Our findings extend previous work on cyclic product codes and we also provide a conjecture for the generator matrix of a general quasi-cyclic product code. We apply our spectral analysis to a specific case and propose a new lower bound for the minimum Hamming distance of a given quasi-cyclic code. Finally, we develop a decoding algorithm for phased burst errors with guaranteed decoding radius.
412196	41219626	An improvement on the bounds of Weil exponential sums over Galois rings with some applications	We have developed a new upper bound for Weil-type exponential sums over Galois rings of characteristic p2, surpassing the previous bound established by Kumar, Helleseth, and Calderbank in 1995. This refined bound is based on the genera of function fields and also includes an analog of McEliece's theorem on the divisibility of the weights of codewords in trace codes over Zp2. These findings have implications for improving the minimum distance estimation of trace codes over Zp2 and the correlation bounds of certain nonlinear p-ary sequences.
412196	41219698	Improved p-ary codes and sequence families from Galois rings	In this paper, the authors use a recent bound on Weil-type exponential sums over Galois rings to construct codes and sequences. This bound provides a lower bound for the minimum distance of a family of codes over ${\mathbb F}_{p}$, mostly nonlinear, of length pm+1 and size $p^{2} \cdot p^{m(D-\lfloor \frac {D}{p^{2}}\rceil)}$, where 1 ≤ D ≤ pm/2. The authors also construct several families of p-ary sequences with low correlation, which are compared to known p-ary sequences of similar period. These new sequences are larger than the family Q(D) in the case of p = 2, but have the same period and maximum non-trivial correlation bound.
412197	41219727	Making learning designs happen in distributed learning environments with GLUE!-PS	The article discusses the limited availability of virtual learning environments (VLEs) that allow teachers to create and reuse learning designs. Many VLEs are not accessible to most teachers due to institutional decisions and contextual constraints. The GLUE!-PS architecture and data model aims to address this issue by allowing teachers to design learning activities using various tools and deploy them in different distributed learning environments. The article demonstrates this by showcasing two authentic learning designs with different pedagogical approaches and how GLUE!-PS helps set up the necessary ICT infrastructure in two different environments (Moodle and wikis).
412197	41219759	Lost in translation from abstract learning design to ICT implementation: a study using moodle for CSCL	The paper discusses the potential loss of information that occurs when teachers' abstract learning design ideas are implemented in virtual learning environments (VLEs) through the life-cycle of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) scripts. The study involved 37 teachers' collaborative learning designs being deployed in Moodle using a specific set of ICT tools. Despite some loss of information, the teachers still found the resulting deployment of learning designs in Moodle to be valid for use in real practice. This suggests that further research should be conducted to improve ICT support for learning design practices in the context of mainstream VLEs.
412197	4121972	Studying participation networks in collaboration using mixed methods.	This paper discusses the application of a mixed-evaluation method to three different learning scenarios, using social network analysis and qualitative and quantitative analysis to study participatory aspects of learning in CSCL (computer-supported collaborative learning) contexts. The three case studies include a blended learning experience, a distance learning experience, and a synchronous experience, demonstrating the flexibility of the method and its tools. The results show that the predefined types of social networks and indexes are appropriate for measuring structural aspects of interaction in CSCL scenarios, and are easily understandable for education practitioners. The mixed-evaluation method and its computational tools also allow for the efficient use of multiple data sources, providing a more comprehensive evaluation. The experiments show the benefits of each data source and analysis technique.
412198	41219831	Collisions for the WIDEA-8 compression function	WIDEA is a family of block ciphers based on the IDEA block cipher. It uses multiple parallel instances of IDEA and an improved key schedule to create larger block sizes. The design is suggested as a compression function for the Davies-Meyer mode. This paper examines the security of WIDEA when used as a compression function. By taking advantage of the slow diffusion in the key schedule, the paper presents practical free-start collisions for WIDEA-8, with a complexity of 213.53.
412198	41219871	Refinements of the ALRED construction and MAC security claims	The authors introduce three security claims for iterated message authentication codes (MAC functions) and propose a construction method, ALRED, which is based on a block cipher and has proven security in the absence of internal collisions. They use this construction to create two MAC functions, ALPHA-MAC and PELICAN, using the advanced encryption standard (AES). The authors also provide a model for describing internal collisions in ALRED and demonstrate that their proposed security claims are applicable to MAC functions using the ALRED construction. They also explain the reasoning behind the security claims for PELICAN. Overall, the authors present a reliable and secure method for constructing MAC functions.
412198	41219816	Numerical Solvers And Cryptanalysis	The paper proposes a novel approach for cryptanalysis of modern cryptographic algorithms using numerical methods. Specifically, the focus is on the stream cipher Trivium, recommended by the eStream project. A reduced version of Trivium, called Bivium A, is attacked using numerical methods by setting up a system of equations for its internal state and converting it into a system over the reals. Four different techniques for this conversion are discussed. Two numerical methods, the DIRECT algorithm and the Interior Reflective Newton Method, are applied to the system. The paper also discusses the results, challenges encountered, and potential future research directions.
412199	41219942	Commutativity analysis for XML updates	The article discusses the use of XQuery extended with update operations as an effective approach to support XML updates. While this approach is user-friendly, it poses difficulties in optimization and analysis due to the undecidability of commutativity in most existing XML update languages. To address this issue, the article proposes a conservative analysis method that uses path analysis to determine commutativity. The method involves computing upper bounds for accessed or modified nodes in an expression and can be used to identify commuting expressions. The article also provides a theorem to support this technique and showcases its application in query optimization with updates.
412199	4121993	View Operations on Objects with Roles for a Statically Typed Database Language	The object data model has been extended to handle the evolving nature of data and multiple views for the same data. This includes two sets of operations: object extension operations, which allow an object to change its type dynamically, and object viewing operations, which allow an object to be viewed with a different structure. These operations are related in that they preserve the identity of the object, but differ in that object extension can change the object's behavior while object viewing creates a new view without changing its behavior. This paper focuses on defining object viewing operations in a statically and strongly typed database programming language, and how they relate to object extension and role mechanisms. The use of these operations is demonstrated with examples from the language Galileo 97.
412199	41219932	Divergence of F≤ type checking	System F ⩽ is a language that extends second-order typed lambda calculus by allowing a subtype hierarchy among types and bounded second-order lambda abstraction. It is used in current research on integrating typed functional languages with subtypes and inheritance. An algorithm for type checking F ⩽ expressions has been known since the language Fun was defined, and has been proven complete by the author and Curien. However, this algorithm is not a decision procedure, as shown by a term that causes it to diverge. Despite this, the algorithm is still considered reliable for most programs and should not prevent the adoption of F ⩽ as a basis for practical programming languages. The paper also proves the undecidability of an important subsystem of F ⩽.
412200	41220049	Towards Fresh and Hybrid Re-Keying Schemes with Beyond Birthday Security.	Fresh re-keying is a security protocol that splits the task of protecting encryption/authentication schemes against side-channel attacks into two parts. One part, the re-keying function, must have certain properties and is based on an algebraic structure that can withstand side-channel attacks. The other part, a block cipher, provides resistance against mathematical attacks and only needs to be secure against single-measurement attacks. This protocol is cheap, stateless, and does not require synchronization between communication parties. However, a recent attack has shown that the first instantiation of fresh re-keying only provides birthday security. In response, this paper proposes two solutions that provide provable security against this attack, one using classical block ciphers and the other using tweakable block ciphers. The paper also discusses the use of fresh/hybrid re-keying for encryption and authentication and warns about their vulnerability to side-channel attacks.
412200	41220031	Collision attacks on the reduced dual-stream hash function RIPEMD-128	This paper focuses on analyzing the security of the RIPEMD-128 hash function against collision attacks. While it has been used as a replacement for other 128-bit hash functions, such as MD5, there has been limited research on its security. The best previous result was a preimage attack for the first 33 steps of the function. However, this work presents new attacks on up to 48 steps, including a collision attack with practical complexity. Additionally, non-random properties for 48 steps are shown, and an example of a collision on the compression function is provided. The authors use complex nonlinear differential characteristics and a general strategy to analyze the function's dual-stream structure, aided by an automatic search tool. 
412200	41220030	Differential attacks on reduced RIPEMD-160	In this paper, the authors analyze the security of RIPEMD-160, a hash function proposed 15 years ago and often used as a replacement for SHA-1. They apply attacks previously used on MD5 and SHA-1 to RIPEMD-160, demonstrating the first practical examples of semi-free-start near-collisions and collisions for a portion of its steps. They also discover that the differential characteristics of RIPEMD-160 are very dense, making a full-round attack unlikely in the near future. This highlights the need for continued analysis and potential updates to the standard. 
412201	41220113	Exploiting coding theory for collision attacks on SHA-1	This article discusses the use of coding theory in the cryptanalysis of hash functions, specifically focusing on the SHA-1 algorithm. The authors introduce various linear codes that are used to identify low-weight differences that can lead to a collision. They also incorporate recent findings in the field to improve upon existing approaches. Through their method, they are able to identify differences with extremely low weight and make a conjecture about the complexity of a full collision attack on SHA-1. 
412201	41220142	Second-preimage analysis of reduced SHA-1	Many applications do not require collision resistance in cryptographic hash functions, but rather preimage resistance. This is why SHA-1 is still recommended for use in most applications, except for digital signatures. However, recent research has shown that SHA-1 may not have as much security margin as previously thought when it comes to second preimage attacks. In this paper, the authors demonstrate this by using known differential properties of SHA-1 to reduce the complexity of a second preimage shortcut attack and show a property that violates a natural second preimage resistance assumption. These findings suggest that there may be potential vulnerabilities in SHA-1 that could potentially compromise its security.
412201	41220132	Rebound Distinguishers: Results on the Full Whirlpool Compression Function	Whirlpool is a hash function derived from AES with a conservative key schedule. A new attack on the full compression function of Whirlpool has been developed by extending the rebound attack with two techniques. This results in a near-collision attack on 9.5 rounds of the compression function with a complexity of 2176 and minimal memory requirements. Furthermore, the near-collision attack has been converted into a distinguishing attack for the full 10 round compression function, making it the first successful attack on the entire Whirlpool compression function.
412202	41220242	Dynamic constraints and database evolution	The relational model, commonly used for databases, has been extended to study the impact of dynamic constraints on database evolution. This extension incorporates both static and dynamic constraints, with a focus on functional dependencies (fd's) and their dynamic counterparts. The interaction between these constraints is explored, considering the influence of the database's past history on the static constraints and the connection between the static constraints and future database evolution. The concepts of age, age-closure, survivability, and survivability-closure are used to analyze these effects. This extension provides insight into the behavior of databases under dynamic constraints. 
412202	41220227	Dynamic functional dependencies and database aging	This article introduces a simple extension of the relational model that incorporates both static and dynamic constraints to analyze the impact of database evolution. The static constraints, known as functional dependencies (FDs), are combined with dynamic constraints involving global updates, referred to as "dynamic" FDs. The article focuses on how these constraints affect the satisfaction of static constraints over time. The concept of age and age closure is used to examine the influence of the past history of the database on the static constraints. Additionally, survivability and survivability closure are briefly discussed in relation to the potential future evolution of the database. 
412202	41220214	Object projection views in the dynamic relational model	This paper introduces a new framework for analyzing user views in a relational database, specifically focusing on "object projection views" where each tuple represents an object. The dynamic relational model is used to capture the database's evolution through updates, and attribute sets that result in object projection views are identified using static and dynamic functional dependencies. The paper also explores the concept of age-closure and the impact of dynamic constraints on view updates. Through the dynamic relational model, the paper shows that valuable insights can be gained about views by examining the database's evolution.

The authors also examine the roles and groups of employees within the network and assess their social position and impact. They analyze the structure of the network to identify employees with similar roles and potential for action within the organization. Additionally, the authors estimate the confidentiality of the network by removing certain communication links between employees and determining the percentage of communications that would disconnect the organization into unconnected parts.

These methods can be applied to analyze any cuisine and can provide valuable information for comparing different cuisines. 
412203	41220346	Stability of decision trees and logistic regression.	Decision trees and logistic regression are commonly used machine learning algorithms for solving real-world problems. The stability of these algorithms is an important factor in analyzing their performance and making reliable conclusions. In this paper, two stability notions are derived for decision trees and logistic regression: hypothesis and pointwise hypothesis stability. L2-regularized logistic regression is found to be uniformly stable. The stability of decision trees depends on the tree's depth, while for logistic regression, it is determined by the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of the cross-entropy loss. Logistic regression is shown to be unstable. Upper bounds on the generalization error of these algorithms are also constructed. A new stability measuring framework is presented, using bootstrap sampling to estimate expected loss differences at an input example. This framework is applied to the three algorithms, confirming the theoretical findings and discussing the potential for new training techniques to optimize the stability of logistic regression and improve its generalization error.
412204	41220424	Efficient Algorithms and Implementations for Optimizing the Sum of Linear Fractional Functions, with Applications	This paper discusses an improved algorithm for solving the sum of linear fractional functions (SOLF) problem in both 1-D and 2-D. The key subproblem is the off-line ratio query (OLRQ) problem, which requires finding optimal values for a sequence of linear fractional functions subject to linear constraints. The algorithm uses geometric properties and parametric linear programming to solve the OLRQ problem in O((m+n)log (m+n)) time. This improves upon previous methods which had a time complexity of O(m(m+n)). The improved algorithm has been shown to outperform other approaches in most cases and has also been applied to problems in computational geometry and other areas. 
412204	41220431	Smallest Maximum-Weight Circle For Weighted Points In The Plane	This paper focuses on finding the smallest possible circle that covers the most weighted points in a given set in the plane. The researchers present an algorithm that can solve this problem in polynomial time, taking into account both positive and negative weights. They also consider a more specific version of the problem where the circle must be centered on a given line and provide an algorithm that runs in O(n(m + n) log(m + n)) time. Additionally, the algorithm can report multiple smaller circles with minimal weight using limited extra space. The paper also discusses different scenarios and provides an algorithm with a faster runtime for cases where all positively weighted points must be included in the circle.
412204	4122048	k-Maximum Subarrays for Small k: Divide-and-Conquer made simpler.	The maximum subarray problem involves finding the contiguous subarray in an array of n real numbers with the largest sum. The k-maximum subarrays problem is a variation where k subarrays with the largest sums are sought. While the divide-and-conquer algorithm is commonly used for the 1-maximum subarray, it is not efficient for larger values of k. This paper presents a divide-and-conquer solution for the k-maximum subarray problem that simplifies the combine phase and improves the overall running time. Additionally, the paper introduces a sublinear time algorithm for finding the k largest sums of two sorted arrays, which is the first of its kind. The algorithm is simple and relies on basic operations, and has shown good performance in testing.
412205	41220516	PurTreeClust: A purchase tree clustering algorithm for large-scale customer transaction data	Clustering customer transaction data is a crucial step in understanding customer behavior in retail and e-commerce companies. This involves organizing products into a product tree, with leaf nodes being individual products and internal nodes representing product categories. To better analyze customer transactions, the concept of a "personalized product tree" or purchase tree is introduced. The PurTreeClust algorithm is then proposed to efficiently cluster large-scale customer data from these purchase trees. This algorithm utilizes a new distance metric and a cover tree for indexing and initial cluster center selection. Additionally, a gap statistic method is proposed to estimate the number of clusters. Experiments on ten large-scale transaction datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of this method compared to other clustering algorithms.
412205	41220543	Finding long and similar parts of trajectories	This article discusses a method for measuring the similarity between two time-dependent trajectories by computing their average distance at corresponding times. It presents algorithms for finding the most similar subtrajectories, assuming the trajectories are given as polygonal lines. When a minimum duration is specified and the subtrajectories must start at the same time, a linear-time algorithm is provided. The article also presents a linear-time algorithm for finding an interval with the minimum average value for a piece-wise monotone function. However, when the subtrajectories can start at different times, the problem becomes more complex and can only be solved approximately with a performance guarantee. The article provides (1+ε)-approximation algorithms for this case, both for specified and minimum duration.
412205	41220522	Mining trajectory corridors using fréchet distance and meshing grids	Trajectory data, collected from location-aware devices, have become prevalent in today's world due to technological advancements. One type of moving pattern is a trajectory corridor, which consists of connected sub-trajectory clusters that can help analyze the behavior of moving objects. In this paper, a three-phase approach is proposed to discover these corridors using the Fréchet distance as a measure of dissimilarity. The first phase involves segmenting trajectories into sub-trajectories using meshing-grids. In the second phase, a hierarchical method is used to cluster these sub-trajectories within each grid cell. Finally, local clusters in each cell are combined to form trajectory corridors. The use of a grid structure allows for efficient segmentation and combination of sub-trajectories, resulting in faster algorithms. Experiments show that the proposed method accurately detects trajectory corridors from real data, and the inclusion of temporal information in the Fréchet distance produces different results compared to using only spatial information. Choosing an appropriate grid size can significantly reduce computation time, as the number of sub-trajectories in a cell affects the speed of the algorithm.
412206	41220638	A generic flash-based animation engine for prob	Writing a formal specification for real-life, industrial problems can be challenging and prone to errors, even for experts in formal methods. It is important to involve domain experts in the process to ensure that the formal model is accurate and in line with their expectations. However, understanding formal models written in a specification language like B may require mathematical knowledge that domain experts may not possess. To address this issue, a new tool has been developed that visualizes B Machines using the ProB animator and Macromedia Flash. This tool allows specifiers to create domain-specific visualizations that can be easily understood by domain experts, helping to ensure that the specification meets their needs.
412206	41220675	Animating and Model Checking B Specifications with Higher-Order Recursive Functions	The B-method is a formal development approach used in critical industries for computer systems. It involves proof activities as well as validation of the initial specification, as having a correct implementation of an incorrect specification can be problematic. Validation can be done through animation and model checking, which checks for certain temporal properties. Previous work has introduced the ProB animator and model checker to support these activities. This work presents two improvements to that previous work. The first is the ability to handle complex functions in realistic specifications, as seen in an example provided by Anthony Hall.
412206	41220630	Mastering the Visualization of Larger State Spaces with Projection Diagrams.	State space visualization is a popular method for analyzing formal models. It provides an overall view of the system, allowing users to identify patterns and unexpected properties. However, as state spaces can become very large, it becomes difficult for humans to inspect the visualizations. To address this issue, a new approach has been developed which reduces the size of the state space by creating projection diagrams. These diagrams are linked with domain-specific visualizations and can be constructed using user-selected elements without prior knowledge of the model's internal structure. This makes the process more accessible to non-formal method experts. The approach has been implemented in the ProB toolset and has shown to be effective in various examples.
412207	41220745	Deriving Linear Size Relations for Logic Programs by Abstract Interpretation	The proposed method is an automatic approach for determining linear size relations between the arguments of atoms in a definite Horn clause program's least Herbrand model, based on a given norm. It utilizes abstract interpretation, with an abstract domain consisting of affine subspaces or linear varieties and operations based on linear algebra. The main purpose of this technique is for automatic termination analysis, but it can also be used for complexity and granularity analysis, as well as specialisation of constraints in constraint logic languages. 
412207	4122073	Polynomial interpretations as a basis for termination analysis of logic programs	The paper presents a new method for determining if definite logic programs will terminate, using polynomial interpretations. This involves assigning polynomials to function and predicate symbols, similar to techniques used in term rewriting systems. This extends traditional techniques used in termination analysis of logic programs, such as linear norms and level mappings, to incorporate arbitrary polynomials. The paper also introduces a constraint-based approach for automatically generating polynomial interpretations that meet termination conditions. The method is based on established concepts and results in termination analysis, and aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of termination analysis for logic programs.
412207	41220716	A Sensible Least Herbrand Semantics for Untyped Vanilla Meta-Programming and its Extension to a Limited Form of Amalgamation	This study focuses on developing a semantics for untyped meta-programs that use non-ground representation for object level variables. The concept of language independence for definite programs is introduced, which expands on range restriction. It is shown that for language independent, definite object programs, there is a direct correspondence between atoms in the least Herbrand model of the program and atoms in the least Herbrand model of the associated meta-program. This allows for the least Herbrand model to be used as a sensible semantics for the meta-program. This approach can also be applied to a limited form of amalgamation.

The results show that migration, especially towards the web, is highly important for Italian companies and they are increasingly using free and open source solutions. However, the adoption of specific tools for migration is limited due to lack of skills and knowledge or inadequate options. The paper concludes by suggesting the need for technology transfer between academia and industry to improve the adoption of software migration techniques and tools.

412208	41220848	On the impact of state-based model-driven development on maintainability: a family of experiments using UniMod.	Model-driven approaches have been widely used in academia, but their adoption in the industry is hindered by the lack of empirical evidence to support their advantages and benefits. This study aims to assess the claimed benefit of model-driven approaches, specifically in terms of improved maintainability compared to a code-centric approach. The study involved five experiments with 100 students of varying education levels. The results showed a reduction in time to complete maintenance tasks and no impact on correctness when using the UniMod-MDD approach. It was also found that the approach almost doubled developers' efficiency and even tripled it for those with more software engineering experience. Overall, the UniMod-MDD approach was found to provide significant benefits in a software maintenance scenario for all categories of students.
412209	41220935	Code Your Own Game: The Case of Children with Hearing Impairments.	The computer science community emphasizes the importance of teaching children coding skills to foster their creativity and not just consume games.

A workshop program was developed and evaluated with 12 DHH children to improve the teaching of coding in current learning environments. A set of guidelines was created through a focus group and content analysis to aid special education teachers, curriculum designers, and K-12 education developers in providing appropriate workshops for DHH children. This initial evaluation shows promise in enhancing the learning experience for DHH students in coding.

412210	41221031	Leftover Hash Lemma, revisited	The Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) is a well-known concept that states that universal hash functions can be used as good randomness extractors. However, LHL-based extractors have two limitations: large entropy loss and large seed length. These limitations can be overcome in certain scenarios, such as deriving secret keys for cryptographic applications. Additionally, a general computational extractor has been developed that can be used for any cryptographic application with low entropy loss. The expand-then-extract approach, which uses a pseudorandom generator to expand a short seed into a longer one before using it in the LHL, has also been studied. It is not always sound, but it can be used with a small number of bits or in certain cases, such as minicrypt. This suggests that it may be secure to use practical pseudorandom generators, even without a proof of security.
412210	4122105	Entropic security and the encryption of high entropy messages	Entropic security is an information-theoretic concept introduced by Russell and Wang and Canetti et al. in the context of encryption and hash functions. It means that knowledge of the output of a probabilistic map (such as an encryption or hash function) does not help predict any function of the input with high min-entropy. This is stronger than the original formulation and is equivalent to indistinguishability on high-entropy input distributions. New results on entropically-secure encryption are then presented, including two general frameworks for construction and lower bounds on the required key length. These results show the near-optimality of the constructions and provide improved parameters.
412210	41221076	Randomness condensers for efficiently samplable, seed-dependent sources	The study of randomness condensers for efficiently samplable sources that depend on a seed is initiated. These are functions that take a random seed and source and produce an output with minimum entropy. Unlike extractors, these condensers can have smaller computational complexity than the sampling algorithm. It is shown that strong collision-resistant hash functions can act as seed-dependent condensers with logarithmic entropy deficiency. These condensers can be used for key derivation in cryptographic applications when the adversary has a negligible success probability. Furthermore, if the condensers are robust to side information from the sampling algorithm, they imply the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir Heuristic in constant-round, public-coin interactive proof systems.
412211	41221145	Fixed Parameter Algorithms For The Minimum Weight Triangulation Problem	This article discusses and compares four different algorithms for finding the minimum weight triangulation of a simple polygon with a total of n vertices, where (n - k) vertices are on the perimeter and k vertices are in the interior. All four algorithms use a divide-and-conquer approach and dynamic programming to improve efficiency. The algorithms are based on two observations about triangulations - triangle splits and path splits. The first two algorithms use only one type of split, while the last two combine both types for better performance. The authors aim to simplify and deepen the understanding of these algorithms by discussing them and presenting experimental results from a Java implementation.
412211	4122118	A fixed parameter algorithm for the minimum number convex partition problem	 The MNCP problem involves finding the minimum number of convex pieces that can partition a given input of an n-vertex convex polygon with k holes or an n-vertex PSLG with k holes and/or reflex vertices. A fixed-parameter tractable algorithm has been developed for this problem, with time complexities of linear time if k is constant, polynomial time in n if k is O(log n/log log n), or O(nk^6k-5 216k) time otherwise.
412211	41221138	A fast approximation algorithm for TSP with neighborhoods	The TSP with neighborhoods (TSPN) problem involves finding the shortest tour that visits a set of k polygonal regions, each with n vertices. This paper presents a fast algorithm that can compute a TSPN tour with a length of O(log k) times the optimum, given a starting point. It also provides a method for finding a "good" starting point, resulting in a logarithmic approximation algorithm. Additionally, an algorithm is presented that either outputs a TSPN tour with a length of O(log k) times the optimum in O(n log n) time or a tour with a length less than (1 + ε) times the optimum in O(n3) time. This approach can also be applied to the Red-Blue Separation Problem, with an algorithm that has a logarithmic approximation ratio and runs in O(n log n) time.
412212	41221273	Semantic representation: search and mining of multimedia content	The ability to understand the meaning of multimedia content is crucial for effective access to digital media data. Semantic content descriptions greatly improve the value of large media repositories by making them searchable. However, automatic semantic understanding is a difficult task and most databases rely on low-level features or manual annotations. Recent techniques focus on detecting semantic concepts in videos, such as indoor, outdoor, face, etc. This requires a fixed lexicon and annotated training examples. This paper discusses the use of semantic concept detection to map videos into semantic spaces, creating a compact representation of the content. Experiments on a large video corpus show improved performance in retrieval, classification, visualization, and data mining using this approach. 
412212	4122129	Multimedia content-based indexing and search: challenges and research directions	The rapid growth of digital multimedia content and the increasing variety of distribution channels has raised users' expectations for easy accessibility and searchability. However, current indexing and search methods are struggling to keep up with the vast amount of content being generated. To address this issue, recent advancements in multimedia content analysis are being utilized to effectively tag and categorize multimedia content. A new system called Marvel is being developed, which uses statistical machine learning and semantic concept ontologies to model, index, and search multimedia content using audio, speech, and visual elements. This system aims to reduce manual processing and improve the ability to unlock the value of large multimedia repositories.

The authors aim to highlight the success of these approaches in effectively searching and browsing through digital video archives, which has important implications for creating accessible digital libraries. These techniques have been proven to work, can handle larger archives, and provide useful retrieval performance for users.
412213	41221334	Conjugacy in Free Inverse Monoids.	Conjugacy, a concept commonly used in groups, can also be applied to monoids in two ways: the first version defines conjugacy as two elements being equal when one can be obtained by rearranging the other, while the second version defines it as two elements being equal when they can be transposed. By using Munn's characterization of elements in free inverse monoids, it is shown that when restricted to non-idempotent elements, the relation of conjugacy is the transitive closure of the relation of transposition. Additionally, it is proven that testing for conjugacy between two elements in a free inverse monoid can be done in linear time.
412213	41221345	On Extendibility of Unavoidable Sets	A subset X of a free monoid is considered unavoidable if almost all words in the monoid contain a subword from X. A conjecture by A. Ehrenfeucht suggests that every unavoidable set is also extendible, meaning that by removing one element and adding a new one, the set remains unavoidable. This conjecture is still unsolved, but some progress has been made in finding partial solutions and developing efficient methods to test for properties related to this problem.
412213	4122130	Decision problems among the main subfamilies of rational relations	The article discusses four families of subsets in a direct product of free monoids: recognizable, synchronous, deterministic rational, and rational. The families form a strict hierarchy and the decision problem of whether a relation belongs to a smaller family is investigated. The problem is solved when all monoids have a unique generator, with some gaps filled in for the general case. The study shows that it is possible to determine if a deterministic subset of multiple free monoids is recognizable, and presents an algorithm for determining if a synchronous relation is recognizable in exponential time.

These codes are commonly used to create sequences with ideal correlation values. The weight hierarchy of the Kasami codes is fully defined, and it has been proven that the chain condition applies to these codes.
412214	41221498	3-Designs from the Z4-Goethals Codes via a New Kloosterman Sum Identity	 This paper discusses the construction of a new type of design, called a t-design, using linear codes over Z4. Specifically, the authors construct a simple 3-design using codewords from the Z4-Goethals code for odd m ≥ 5. The design has parameters 3 − (2m, 7, \frac{14}{3} (2m − 8)) and is obtained by counting the number of codewords of Hamming weight 7 in the code that contain any 3 chosen positions. This counting is simplified using the double-transitivity of the code and is related to Kloosterman sums. The paper also presents a new identity for Kloosterman sums as a result of this construction.

The weight enumerator polynomial, A(z), is presented for different values of k. It is also shown how to find A(z) by studying the generator matrix of a linear code. The weight distribution is studied for maximum distance separable codes, maximal shift register codes, and semiprimitive codes. The weight distribution of irreducible cyclic codes over GF(2) is tabulated for n1 ⩽ 17.
412215	41221545	Analysis of the 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access function	We have developed a mathematical model to analyze the performance of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) function in the IEEE 802.11e standard. Our model uses a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) and takes into account important quality-of-service (QoS) features such as contention window, arbitration interframe space, and transmit opportunity differentiation. This model considers the state of the MAC layer buffer, as well as MAC differentiation mechanisms, to provide a comprehensive analysis of performance under different traffic loads. Our results, obtained through both analytical and simulation methods, demonstrate the accuracy of our model for various EDCA parameters and MAC layer buffer sizes. 
412215	4122154	Performance Analysis of the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function Using Cycle Time Approach	The IEEE 802.11e standard has been recently ratified and it introduces the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) function for providing quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless local area networks (WLANs). EDCA uses CSMA/CA and BEB mechanisms and a mathematical analysis framework has been developed to analyze its performance. This analysis takes into account the cyclic nature of distributed random access systems, where each station successfully transmits a packet in a cycle. The results show that there is a specific cycle time for each access category (AC) in EDCA. By validating the results through simulations, it is shown that this analysis accurately predicts the saturation performance of EDCA in terms of throughput, medium access delay, and packet loss ratio. This cycle time analysis is a simpler and more insightful alternative to previous complex EDCA models.
412215	41221571	Modeling the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function	The IEEE 802.11e standard includes the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function, which assigns different parameters such as Contention Window (CW), Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS), and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to different Access Categories (AC) in order to improve Quality-of-Service (QoS) at the MAC level. This paper presents an analytical model for the EDCA function that accurately considers the differentiation of CW, AIFS, and TXOP at all levels of traffic load. The model also accounts for the impact of MAC layer buffer size on performance. Results from both analytical and simulation methods show that the proposed model is highly accurate for various traffic loads, EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer sizes.
412216	41221687	Optimal Neighborhood Kernel Clustering with Multiple Kernels.	Multiple kernel k-means (MKKM) is a clustering algorithm that aims to improve performance by learning an optimal kernel, which is a linear combination of pre-specified base kernels. However, this approach may limit the kernel's representation capability and not fully consider the negotiation between kernel learning and clustering, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To address these issues, an optimal neighborhood kernel clustering (ONKC) algorithm is proposed, which enhances the representability of the optimal kernel and strengthens the negotiation between learning and clustering. Theoretical justification shows that existing MKKM algorithms are a special case of ONKC and that it can be extended for better clustering algorithms. An efficient algorithm is designed to solve the optimization problem with proven convergence. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ONKC compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
412216	41221652	Multiple Kernel k-Means Clustering with Matrix-Induced Regularization.	Multiple kernel k-means (MKKM) clustering aims to improve clustering performance by optimally combining a group of pre-specified kernels. However, existing MKKM algorithms do not adequately consider the correlation among these kernels. This can lead to selecting redundant kernels, which decreases the diversity of information sources used for clustering and ultimately harms performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an MKKM clustering approach with a novel matrix-induced regularization that reduces redundancy and enhances kernel diversity. This regularization is theoretically justified by its connection to the commonly used kernel alignment criterion. Experimental results on five benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of this approach compared to existing MKKM algorithms, indicating its potential for designing better clustering algorithms. 
412216	4122162	Multiple kernel extreme learning machine.	Extreme learning machine (ELM) has gained significant attention in the past decade due to its high efficiency and ability to handle various learning tasks, such as classification and regression. However, existing ELM algorithms have not adequately addressed the optimization of kernel choices, which greatly impacts the performance of ELM in real-world applications. Moreover, there is a lack of a general framework for ELM to integrate multiple types of data for classification. To address these issues, the authors propose a new framework called multiple kernel extreme learning machines (MK-ELM). This framework optimizes both the kernel combination weights and the structural parameters of ELM. The authors also introduce three efficient optimization algorithms to solve the corresponding learning problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods, with significantly less computational cost.

It also introduces a new user interface designed to support these techniques. This approach differs from other user interfaces in that it is uniform and supports a wider range of types in the persistent store. The paper also mentions two prototype versions of these facilities implemented for the Napier88 language.

412220	41222028	On Store Languages of Language Acceptors.	Pushdown automata are a type of language acceptor that use a stack to keep track of intermediate steps in a computation. The "store language" of a pushdown automaton, which includes all possible state and stack configurations during a computation, is known to be a regular language. This concept is explored further by examining different models of language acceptors and their store languages. Connections between one-way and two-way machines, as well as between deterministic and nondeterministic machines, are also discussed. The results of these studies have practical applications, such as a technique for proving that families of languages accepted by deterministic machines are closed under right quotient with regular languages. Additionally, lower bounds on the space complexity of Turing machines with non-regular store languages are determined.

This characterization allows for simple proofs of previously known results, such as the semilinearity of the Parikh map of any language accepted by an NPCM. The authors also prove a Chomsky-Schutzenberger-like theorem stating that a language can be accepted by an NPCM if and only if it can be represented as the intersection of a Dyck language and a regular set, using a homomorphism and a set of distinguished symbols. They also explore other machine models, such as visibly pushdown automata with reversal-bounded counters (VPCMs) and investigate the complexity of decision problems for these grammatical models. Finally, they introduce other equivalent grammatical models for NPCM.
412221	41222147	Coalgebraic Hybrid Logic	This article introduces a framework called coalgebraic hybrid logic, which allows for reasoning about individual states in a model using modal logics with nominals and satisfaction operators. This framework is as general as coalgebraic modal logic and encompasses various logics with non-normal modal operators such as probabilistic, graded, or coalitional modalities and non-monotonic conditionals. The authors prove a generic finite model property and a weak completeness result, and provide a semantic criterion for decidability in PSPACE. They also present a fully internalised PSPACE tableau calculus. These generic results can be applied to specific hybrid logics, resulting in new findings such as the decidability of probabilistic and graded hybrid logics in PSPACE.

This approach is extended in this paper with the introduction of the coalgebraic µ-calculus, which includes fixpoint operators. The paper proves the completeness of the associated tableau calculus and shows that the satisfiability problem can be reduced to the existence of winning strategies in parity games. This approach is applicable to a wide range of models and provides new complexity bounds for the probabilistic µ-calculus and an extended version of coalition logic.
412221	41222114	PSPACE bounds for rank-1 modal logics	.The complexity of establishing a bound for a modal logic can be a difficult task due to the lack of general algorithmic methods. However, the current work is a step towards a general theory of the complexity of modal logics. The main finding is that all rank-1 logics have a shallow model property and can be solved in polynomial space (PSPACE), with some assumptions on the format of their axiomatization. This leads to a unified derivation of tight PSPACE-bounds for various logics, including K, coalition logic, and graded modal logic, as well as a new algorithm for probabilistic modal logic with rational probabilities. This is possible due to the use of coalgebraic semantics, which allows for a uniform approach to covering a wide range of logics.
412222	41222262	Twitinfo: aggregating and visualizing microblogs for event exploration	Microblogs, such as Twitter, contain a vast amount of user-generated content about world events.

Evaluations have shown that users can reconstruct meaningful event summaries quickly, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has confirmed its usefulness for understanding long-running events and identifying eyewitnesses. Quantitatively, the system can identify 80-100% of manually labeled peaks, providing a comprehensive view of each event.

412223	41222351	Multiple Coloring of Cone Graphs	This paper discusses the $k$th chromatic number of cone graphs, which are created by adding a "cone" of vertices to an existing graph. The $k$th chromatic number, denoted by $\chi_k(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to assign to each vertex in a $k$-fold coloring of the graph $G$. An upper bound for $\chi_k(\mu_m(G))$, the $k$th chromatic number of the cone graph of $G$, is presented in terms of $\chi_k(G)$, $k$, and $m$. It is also shown that there is a connection between the $k$th chromatic number of the cone graph and the circular chromatic number of $G$. Surprisingly, if $\chi_k(G)$ and $\chi_c(G)$ are even, then for sufficiently large $m$, the $k$th chromatic number of the cone graph is equal to the $k$th chromatic number of $G$.
412223	412223100	Circular consecutive choosability of k-choosable graphs	The circular consecutive choosability of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to assign to its vertices so that each vertex can be assigned a color from a closed interval on a circle of a given circumference. The relationship between this and the traditional choosability of a graph is investigated, and it is proven that for k-choosable graphs, the circular consecutive choosability is at most k+1-1/k. The equality holds for k≥3, and for k=2, the circular consecutive choosability is at most 2 if and only if the graph contains a cycle. However, there are some graphs that are circular consecutive 2-choosable but not 2-choosable. The circular consecutive choosability is found to be 2 for all cycles and for K2,n with n≥2. Some generalized theta graphs also have a circular consecutive choosability of 2.

The minimum weight of a proper r-coloring is denoted as sigma(G, w, r) and the minimum of this value for all r is denoted as sigma(G, w). An optimal coloring is one where w(c) is equal to sigma(G, w). The problem of determining the number of colors needed in an optimal coloring is related to the First-Fit coloring algorithm. It is shown that for trees, the number of colors needed can be arbitrarily large, while for graphs of path-width k, it is at most 40(k+1). A polynomial time algorithm is provided to determine if a weighted graph of bounded tree-width satisfies a given value of sigma(G, w, r).

412228	4122281	Analyzing settings for social identity management on Social Networking Sites: Classification, current state, and proposed developments.	The increasing use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) has led to new privacy challenges and has prompted users to manage their online identity. This is referred to as Social Identity Management (SIdM), which involves deliberately disclosing personal information to a select group of contacts or other users on the SNS. However, protection against entities such as the site operator or advertisers is not covered by SIdM and needs to be addressed separately. While some SNS have implemented features and settings for SIdM, there is a lack of integration and a reference framework to guide users in managing their identity. This article proposes a reference framework for SIdM based on identity theory, literature analysis, and existing SNS. It also examines the current SIdM capabilities of popular SNS and suggests possible improvements. Lastly, the idea of developing a metric to compare the SIdM capabilities of different SNS is discussed.

The objective is to maximize a partition function that depends on the sum of elements in each set. The authors use the theory of majorization and Schur convexity to study optimal multipartitions for this problem. They also use these results to disprove a conjecture by Du and Hwang, which suggests that Schur convex functions can be characterized as the partition functions for (1, n, m)-multipartitioning problems with monotone optimal solutions. 
412231	41223136	Formulation of linear problems and solution by a universal machine	The predicate language for ordered fields is used to define a class of problems called linear problems, which includes systems of linear equations and inequalities, linear programming and integer programming problems, and more. A single algorithm, called the Universal Linear Machine, is described that can solve any instance of any linear problem. This algorithm has two phases: a Compiler phase where a linear algorithm is generated, and a solving phase where the algorithm solves a specific instance of the problem. The linear algorithm only uses basic ordered field operations and is finite, deterministic, and loopless. It is also shown that every linear algorithm can uniquely solve a linear problem and can be used to solve parametric instances as well.
412232	41223235	The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of graph and recursive neural networks.	The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dim) is a measure of the sample learning complexity of a classification model and is often used to evaluate its generalization capability. While the VC-dim has been studied for common feed-forward neural networks, this paper explores its application to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recursive Neural Networks (RecNNs). These models are capable of processing graph inputs, which are a more general form than sequences and vectors. The paper provides upper bounds on the VC-dim of GNNs and RecNNs, showing that their generalization capability increases with the number of connected nodes. This finding is similar to previous results for recurrent neural networks, which also have a higher VC-dim compared to traditional neural networks. 
412232	41223241	Recurrent Neural Network Architectures: An Overview	The paper discusses recurrent neural network architectures, dividing them into two subclasses. It is found that all popular recurrent neural network architectures fall into one of these subclasses and cannot be transformed into the other. Two newer architectures designed for specific purposes are also examined. The paper then suggests that once the architectural aspects are settled, the training process can be further explored in a separate paper. 
412232	41223229	Noisy Time Series Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks and Grammatical Inference	Financial forecasting is a difficult task due to various challenges such as small sample sizes, high noise, non-stationarity, and non-linearity. Neural networks have proven to be successful in signal processing, but they also have limitations when dealing with high noise and small sample size signals. A new method is introduced that uses a symbolic representation and grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks to address these difficulties. This method was applied to predict daily foreign exchange rates and showed promising results with an error rate of 47.1%. The symbolic representation also allows for the extraction of symbolic knowledge in the form of deterministic finite state automata, which explain the functioning of the system and often reveal simple rules related to well-known behaviors. 
412233	412233128	CASA-Based Robust Speaker Identification	Conventional speaker recognition systems struggle to accurately identify speakers in noisy environments. To address this, researchers have turned to computational auditory scene analysis (CASA), which uses a time-frequency mask to separate speech signals. In this study, the researchers introduce a new speaker feature called gammatone frequency cepstral coefficient (GFCC), which is based on an auditory model and outperforms traditional speaker features in noisy conditions. To improve performance, CASA separation is applied and either reconstructed or marginalized components are used based on the mask. Combining these methods results in a highly effective system that outperforms other similar systems in a variety of noise levels.
412233	41223313	Robust speaker identification using auditory features and computational auditory scene analysis	The effectiveness of speaker recognition systems decreases in noisy environments. To address this issue, new auditory features and a robust recognition system were proposed based on computational auditory scene analysis. The features were further studied by varying dimensions and including dynamic features. They were evaluated in a speaker identification task under various noisy conditions and one of the auditory features showed better performance compared to conventional speaker features. The recognition system also outperformed an advanced front-end in different signal-to-noise conditions. This highlights the potential of using auditory features and a robust recognition system for handling noisy environments in speaker recognition.
412233	41223384	Binary and ratio time-frequency masks for robust speech recognition	A time-varying Wiener filter is used to determine the ratio of a target signal and noise in a specific time-frequency unit. This ratio is estimated using a binaural processor and converted into a time-frequency mask, which is then used to isolate the speech signal. The extracted speech signal is then fed to a speech recognition system operating in the cepstral domain. This system is compared with a missing-data recognizer, which also uses the binaural processor to determine an ideal binary time-frequency mask. The missing-data recognizer performs better on a small vocabulary task, but the conventional recognizer outperforms it when the vocabulary size is increased. 
412234	41223416	A Note on Multiple-Access Channels with Strictly-Causal State Information	This content discusses a new inner bound for the capacity region of a memoryless multiple-access channel that is influenced by a known, strictly causal state. The proposed bound includes previous bounds and is shown to be strictly better through an example. A variation of this example is applied to a scenario where the channel is influenced by two independent state sequences, with each transmitter having knowledge of one of the states. This proves a previous conjecture by Li et al. that their inner bound for this scenario is indeed better than previous bounds.
412234	41223427	On the Capacity of the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel	The article discusses the asymptotic capacity of a discrete-time Poisson channel, taking into consideration peak-power and average-power limitations. A new lower bound and an asymptotic upper bound are derived, with the upper bound utilizing the concept of capacity-achieving input distributions that escape to infinity. The lower bound is based on the entropy of a conditionally Poisson random variable, using the differential entropy of its conditional mean. These bounds provide a better understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the channel capacity and can be useful in designing efficient communication systems.
412234	41223439	Bounds on the capacity of a spectrally constrained Poisson channel	A study on the capacity of a Poisson channel has been conducted, considering a stationary input process and peak and average power constraints. An upper bound has been derived, which becomes tighter as the spectral constraints are relaxed. The maximization of this bound over a set of allowable spectra is closely related to a problem in the AWGN regime. This upper bound is then used to determine the capacity of a Poisson channel under a second-moment-bandwidth constraint and a strict bandwidth constraint. Lower bounds on the channel capacity for these cases have also been presented. Additionally, the study has produced improved bounds on the bit-error probability for uncoded amplitude shift keying (and on-off modulation) on a Poisson channel with intersymbol interference. 
412235	41223532	Power efficient rate monotonic scheduling for multi-core systems	Current real-time systems offer more computational power to handle CPU intensive applications, but this leads to increased energy consumption and heat dissipation. To address these issues, system speed is adjusted in real-time to meet application deadlines and reduce overall energy consumption. The use of multi-core technology also presents opportunities for energy reduction through efficient scheduling, but there is limited research on this topic. This paper proposes a technique for finding the lowest core speed for scheduling tasks, which is shown to be superior to existing methods. Additionally, a task shifting policy is used to balance core utilization and determine a uniform system speed for a given task set, ensuring that all tasks meet their deadlines and energy consumption is reduced.
412235	41223541	Survey on Grid Resource Allocation Mechanisms	Grid is a distributed computing model that provides resources such as computing power, storage, and communication for resource-intensive user tasks. Efficient task scheduling is crucial for achieving high system throughput and meeting user requirements. However, the increasing complexity of Grid systems has made task scheduling more challenging. This paper examines existing resource allocation mechanisms for Grid systems, including centralized, distributed, static, and dynamic architectures. The mechanisms are compared based on various factors such as time complexity, search method, allocation strategy, optimality, and objective function. This comprehensive analysis helps readers understand important concepts and issues in Grid resource allocation, aiding them in selecting the most suitable mechanism for their system or application. 
412235	41223534	Optimal task execution times for periodic tasks using nonlinear constrained optimization	Designing real-time systems is a complex process, with one of the main challenges being finding appropriate values for task parameters such as periods, deadlines, and computation times. While periods and deadlines are typically fixed, computation times can fluctuate significantly. The higher the computation time, the better the system's quality of service or utilization, but this can also lead to infeasibility. Currently, there is no optimal solution for determining the best computation times to ensure system feasibility. In this paper, the authors propose a generalized bound for task schedulability that can be used to optimize task execution times while meeting temporal requirements. Simulations show that this approach outperforms the current standard method.
412236	41223628	Dynamic Organization Schemes for Cooperative Proxy Caching	In a cooperative caching architecture, web proxies work together in a mesh network. If a proxy cannot fulfill a request, it is sent to other nodes in the network. However, since local caches can only satisfy a small percentage of requests, this can result in a high volume of queries being directed to neighboring nodes, which can strain system resources. Due to variations in traffic, overlapping content, and distance between nodes, it is not necessary for each proxy to cooperate with every node in the mesh. Limiting the number of neighboring nodes can also help with scalability, as having N proxies in a mesh can lead to a high number of queries (N2). Therefore, it is beneficial to restrict the number of neighbors for each proxy to a certain value, k.
412236	41223685	Dynamic scheduling of multimedia documents in a single server multiple clients environment	In a single server and multiple client distributed multimedia system, the server needs to quickly respond to clients' requests for multimedia documents while guaranteeing quality of service. However, existing scheduling algorithms have two major drawbacks: they assume all channels are available at the beginning and ignore the cost of scheduling. To address this, a feasible scheduling algorithm should be real-time, have low scheduling cost, and handle multiple requests. This paper proposes two dynamic scheduling algorithms with a worst time complexity of O ( n log nm + nm ), which adjusts scheduling times based on the slack time between requests. This reduces response time and maintains presentation quality. Simulation and analysis show the effectiveness of these algorithms in a realistic environment.
412236	41223619	Static and adaptive distributed data replication using genetic algorithms	Our daily lives heavily rely on quick access to information through large distributed systems like the Internet. However, delays during peak hours are a common issue for end-users. One solution to reducing network traffic is replicating certain objects at multiple sites. This decision requires solving a complex optimization problem, which is typically difficult for a Genetic Algorithm (GA). To address this, a static GA was proposed for cases with consistent read/write demands, showing superior results compared to a simple greedy method. However, the static GA has a long running time and may not be applicable for constantly changing demands, such as in breaking news situations. To handle this, a hybrid GA was developed that takes into account network attributes and changes to compute a new replica distribution. This approach was evaluated considering storage capacity constraints and varying object popularity, and the trade-off between running time and solution quality was examined.
412237	41223750	MM: A bidirectional search algorithm that is guaranteed to meet in the middle.	Bidirectional search algorithms combine two separate searches, one starting from the initial state and the other starting from the goal state. While adding a heuristic to unidirectional search greatly reduces the search effort, bidirectional heuristic search has not been as successful despite years of research. This is due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of its nature. This paper introduces a new bidirectional heuristic search algorithm called MM, which guarantees that the forward and backward searches will meet in the middle. This allows for a unique comparison with A* and their brute-force variations by dividing the state space into sections based on their distance from the start and goal. Experimental results support the theoretical analysis and identify the conditions where each algorithm is most effective.
412237	41223721	Automatic move pruning for single-agent search.	Move pruning is a technique used to reduce the cost of single-agent search problems by avoiding the generation of duplicate states. This is achieved by suppressing redundant sequences of moves that have the same effect as other sequences. Researchers have developed an algorithm for automatically identifying these redundant move sequences and a method for selecting which ones to prune during search. Careful selection of which sequences to prune is crucial for the success of this technique. Experimental results have shown significant speedups in various domains using this method. The researchers also discuss theoretical results on when move pruning may or may not affect the correctness of different search algorithms.
412237	41223754	Front-to-End Bidirectional Heuristic Search with Near-Optimal Node Expansions.	In order for a unidirectional heuristic search algorithm to be effective, it must expand all states with a smaller $f$-value than the optimal solution cost, also known as surely expanded (s.e.) states. A recent study found that when using consistent heuristics in bidirectional search, at least one of the two s.e. states must be expanded. This paper introduces a new admissible bidirectional heuristic search algorithm, Near-Optimal Bidirectional Search (NBS), which has a maximum of 2VC expansions. The paper also proves that no front-to-end algorithm can have a worse worst-case performance than 2VC. NBS has shown promising results in comparison to other bidirectional search algorithms and even outperforms the popular A* algorithm in some cases.
412238	4122385	Stochastic link and group detection	Link detection and analysis has been crucial in the social sciences and government intelligence community. While most efforts focus on analyzing known networks, the abundance of circumstantial data from the internet and other sources has led to the need for probabilistic evidence of links. To address this, a probabilistic model of link generation based on group membership has been proposed. This model takes into account both observed link evidence and demographic information of the entities. The parameters of the model are learned through a maximum likelihood search, which is made tractable through various heuristics. The model and optimization methods are tested on both synthetic data with known ground truth and a database of news articles.
412238	41223851	Actively learning level-sets of composite functions	Scientists often have multiple experiments and data sets to test the validity of their models and determine possible values for model parameters. By examining multiple data sources, scientists can gather more informative inferences compared to analyzing each data source independently. Standard techniques for combining data involve creating a weighted sum of the observed data, and the process of finding constraints on the model parameter space can be expressed as finding a level-set of this target function. This study proposes an active learning algorithm that selects both a sample from the parameter space and an observable function to compute the next sample. Tests on synthetic and real data show that this algorithm significantly reduces the number of samples needed to identify the desired level-set.
412238	41223877	Detecting anomalous records in categorical datasets	The problem of detecting anomalies in high arity categorical datasets is being discussed. Anomalies are defined as abnormal data points, and the focus is on unsupervised anomaly detection using unlabelled data for training. The standard approach involves creating a model of normal data and comparing test records against it, while a probabilistic approach uses a likelihood model. For categorical attributes, bayes nets are used as a standard representation of the likelihood. However, this approach often detects rare attribute values as anomalies, which may not be desired. To address this issue, an alternative definition of anomalies is proposed, where the marginal distribution of attribute subsets is compared. This approach has shown better performance on various datasets.
412239	412239134	Productivity of test driven development: a controlled experiment with professionals	The popularity of Extreme Programming has led to a rise in interest for test driven development (TDD). As a result, many experiments have been conducted to determine if TDD is more effective than the traditional method of testing code after it has been written (TAC). However, research on TDD is still in its early stages and there is limited knowledge on the subject. This paper presents an experiment conducted in a Spanish software company to compare productivity between TDD and TAC. The results suggest that TDD may be more efficient, but further research is needed to fully understand its benefits.
412239	41223987	Evaluating performances of pair designing in industry	Pair programming, a practice where two developers work together on a single task, has gained attention from both practitioners and researchers. Evidence from controlled experiments has shown that it can lead to improved quality and delivery time in software development. This practice can also be applied to other phases of the software process, such as analysis, design, and testing. However, applying pair programming to the design phase may not have the same benefits as in the development phase due to the asymmetry between design and coding. A controlled experiment was conducted in a software company to investigate the effects of pair programming in the design phase. The results showed that although it may slow down the task, it can lead to improved quality. These findings were similar to a previous exploratory experiment involving students. 
412239	412239106	Evaluating Op-Code Frequency Histograms in Malware and Third-Party Mobile Applications.	Mobile malware is becoming more prevalent as smartphones continue to gain popularity around the world. Malware authors are using advanced techniques to evade detection, making traditional anti-malware technologies less effective. Zero-day malware is particularly difficult to detect using signature-based methods, while dynamic analysis techniques are too expensive and impractical for everyday use. This paper introduces a new method for identifying Android malware by analyzing features from the Dalvik code, rather than relying on signatures. Experiments showed that this technique has a high success rate in detecting mobile malware, and can also identify the specific malware family and source of the application.
412240	41224060	Assessing the usability of a visual tool for the definition of e-learning processes	The paper discusses a usability study of a visual language-based tool called ASCLO-S, which is designed for developing adaptive e-learning processes. The tool uses flow diagrams to define different classes of learners and determine the most suitable adaptive learning process for each class. The study used a questionnaire-based survey and an empirical analysis to gather feedback and measure the usability of the tool. The results showed that both the visual notation and the system prototype were user-friendly for instructional designers, regardless of their experience with computers or e-learning tools. The empirical analysis also revealed that the effort required to develop e-learning processes was not affected by the instructional designer's experience, but rather by the size of the process.
412240	41224088	Search-Based Testing of Procedural Programs: Iterative Single-Target or Multi-target Approach?	Researchers have proposed search-based methods for automatically generating test suites for Object-Oriented (OO) software systems. These methods consider all targets (e.g., branches) defined by the coverage criterion simultaneously, in what is known as a multi-target approach. This approach aims to overcome the problem of wasted search budget that can occur with iterative single-target approaches, which generate test cases for each target separately. However, this approach has not been studied in the context of procedural programs. This paper presents OCELOT, a tool for generating test data for C programs that implements both a whole suite approach and a more efficient iterative single-target approach. An empirical study on 35 open-source C programs shows that the iterative single-target approach achieves the same or higher coverage levels with higher efficiency compared to the whole suite approach.
412240	41224026	Software Re-Modularization Based on Structural and Semantic Metrics	The way a software system is structured has a significant impact on its ability to be maintained. To improve maintainability, software systems are typically organized into smaller subsystems using packages or modules. However, as the software evolves, its structure may deviate from its original design, resulting in lower quality. In this paper, the authors suggest an approach to help maintainers improve the quality of software modularization by analyzing the relationships between classes within a package and identifying chains of strongly related classes. These chains are then used to create new packages with better cohesion. The approach was tested on an open source system and two systems developed by student teams, showing promising results for improving software quality.
412241	41224134	On Relating Heterogeneous Elements from Different Ontologies	The majority of distributed ontology integration formalisms utilize mapping languages to express semantic relations between concepts of different ontologies. These mappings, known as homogeneous mappings, can handle a large portion of heterogeneities between ontologies. However, there is a need for mapping languages that can also express semantic relations between properties, known as heterogeneous mappings. This is necessary to reconcile different representations of the same real-world aspect in different ontologies. The authors have proposed a rich mapping language that incorporates both homogeneous and heterogeneous mappings, extending the semantics of Distributed Description Logics (DDL). They provide a sound and complete axiomatization for these mappings, which is a crucial step towards representing an arbitrary network of ontologies.
412241	41224136	A Context-Based Logic for Distributed Knowledge Representation and Reasoning	This paper introduces a logic, called Distributed First Order Logic (DFOL), for formalizing distributed knowledge representation and reasoning systems. These systems consist of different subsystems, each with its own language, partial knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. These subsystems can exchange knowledge through query answering. DFOL represents each subsystem as a context with its own language, basic facts, and inference rules. Knowledge exchange is represented by relations on the languages and domains of different contexts. DFOL is based on a semantics called Local Models Semantics, which allows for modeling diverse contexts and their relations. An axiomatization for DFOL is also provided. 
412241	41224142	Using Wrapper Agents to Answer Queries in Distributed Information Systems	The main goal of information integration is to provide a comprehensive view of information from multiple sources. This is important for designing applications that use data from various sources. The global view is represented by a global schema, which is different from the individual source schemata. However, users working with local applications cannot easily access the global view as their applications are based on local schemata. To address this issue, a multi-agent architecture is proposed where wrapper agents play a key role in integrating information from various sources. This allows users to access global information through their usual local applications.
412242	41224290	A fast algorithm to binarize and filter documents with back-to-front interference	This paper discusses a common issue known as "back-to-front interference" that occurs when documents are written on both sides of translucent paper. This interference makes it difficult to accurately binarize the documents, resulting in unreadable images. To address this problem, the paper presents a fast and effective segmentation-based method that uses the entropy of the image's histogram. This approach produces high-quality binarized images, making the documents easier to read and analyze. Overall, the proposed method offers a solution for effectively binarizing documents with back-to-front interference.
412242	41224226	Detailing a Quantitative Method for Assessing Algorithms to Remove Back-to-Front Interference in Documents	Back-to-front interference, also known as bleeding or showthrough, occurs when documents are written on both sides of translucent paper, making the ink visible from one side on the other. This creates unreadable documents when directly binarized. To address this issue, the literature offers various algorithms for removing the interference. This paper introduces a quantitative approach to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms. By assessing the ability of algorithms to remove back-to-front interference, this method can aid in the selection of the most suitable algorithm for a given document.
412242	41224272	A quantitative method for assessing algorithms to remove back-to-front interference in documents	Back-to-front interference is an artifact that occurs when documents are written on both sides of translucent paper, causing the ink from one side to be visible on the other. This can make the document difficult to read, and there are various algorithms that have been developed to remove this interference. A new method has been proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms in removing back-to-front interference. By properly addressing this issue, the readability of documents can be improved.
412243	41224357	Fair Rate Allocation In Some Gaussian Multiaccess Channels	The article discusses how to achieve all points in the capacity region of Gaussian multiple access channels through successive decoding and time-sharing. It proposes a criterion of fairness based on the theory of majorization, also known as the Lorenz order in economics. The article shows that a unique solution exists for this criterion in a large class of channels, and this fair solution is the same as the well-known Nash bargaining solution. This is due to the special structure of the capacity region. The article also presents a fast algorithm to compute this fair point in certain cases, making it a strong operational choice.
412243	41224318	On the Fairness of Rate Allocation in Gaussian Multiple Access Channel and Broadcast Channel	A channel's capacity region comprises all possible rate vectors. Selecting a point within this region determines the rate allocation. This paper focuses on fairness in rate allocation and examines various fairness concepts such as max-min fairness, proportional fairness, and Nash bargaining solution. The efficiencies of these concepts in multiuser channels are discussed. The application of these ideas to the Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) and Gaussian broadcast channel (BC) is explored. It is shown that in the Gaussian MAC, max-min fairness and proportional fairness are equivalent. Efficient algorithms for finding fair points in the capacity region for both Gaussian MAC and BC are proposed, and some basic properties of fair rate allocations are demonstrated.
412243	4122433	Fair resource allocation for the Gaussian broadcast channel with ISI	The article discusses the challenge of achieving proportional fairness in Gaussian frequency-division broadcast channels with intersymbol interference. This involves allocating power and subchannels in a way that is fair to all users. The problem of allocating subchannels is found to be NP-hard, but can be simplified if users are allowed to time-share a subchannel. For the joint power and subchannel allocation problem, the authors propose an iterative method that solves both problems alternately. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Overall, the article highlights the difficulty of resource allocation in these types of channels and presents a viable solution for achieving fairness. 
412244	41224485	On RAC drawings of 1-planar graphs.	1-planar graphs are graphs that can be drawn with each edge crossing at most once. A k-bend RAC drawing is a special type of drawing where each edge has at most k bends and edges only cross at right angles. A graph is considered k-bend RAC if it has a k-bend RAC drawing. A 0-bend RAC graph is also known as a straight-line RAC graph. The relationship between 1-planar and k-bend RAC graphs has been studied, and it has been shown that not all 1-planar graphs are straight-line RAC and not all straight-line RAC graphs are 1-planar. The complexity of deciding whether a graph has a drawing that is both 1-planar and straight-line RAC is still an open question, and it has been proven to be NP-hard. However, it has been shown that every 1-planar graph has a drawing that is both 1-planar and 1-bend RAC. This paper answers both of these questions by proving the NP-hardness of the first question and providing a drawing algorithm for 1-planar graphs that satisfies both conditions.
412244	41224436	The Rectangle of Influence Drawability Problem	A proximity drawing of a graph is a straight-line drawing where adjacent vertices are represented by points that are close according to a proximity measure. A rectangle of influence drawing is a proximity drawing where the measure is based on a rectangle of influence, which is an axis-aligned rectangle with two points at opposite corners. In this study, the drawability of various graph classes using both open and closed rectangle of influence models is examined. It is shown that determining if a graph has a rectangle of influence drawing can be done in linear time, and if so, a drawing can be constructed in the same amount of time. The algorithms used produce drawings with vertices at integer grid intersections and only use integer operations.
412244	41224411	An Experimental Study On The Ply Number Of Straight-Line Drawings	The ply number, a new measure for graph drawing, is defined as the maximum number of overlapping disks in a straight-line drawing of a graph. This paper presents the findings of an experimental study examining the relationship between ply numbers and other aesthetic metrics, such as stress and edge crossings. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of various graph drawing algorithms in terms of ply number and offers new insights on the theoretical bounds for the ply number of k-ary trees. 
412245	41224554	Achieving the degrees of freedom of 2×2×2 interference network with arbitrary antenna configurations	This paper examines the degrees of freedom (DoF) region in a 2 × 2 × 2 interference network, consisting of two sources, two relays, and two destinations, each with varying numbers of antennas. The authors demonstrate that using linear transceivers, the cut-set outer bound can be reached without requiring additional symbol extensions, except for one specific system setup with a one-DoF gap. Different techniques such as interference avoidance, cancelation, neutralization, and alignment are employed by the transceivers to achieve the outer bound, depending on the antenna configuration. These findings provide insight into the optimal design of transceivers for interference networks with multiple antennas.
412245	412245137	Feasibility Conditions for Interference Neutralization in Relay-Aided Interference Channel	Interference neutralization (IN) is a new method for managing interference in networks with relays. This paper examines the feasibility of using IN for relay-aided multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) interference broadcast channels without symbol extension. The study focuses on fully connected symmetric systems with multiple antennas at each base station, relay, and user. The necessary condition for generalized IN is first presented, followed by the necessary and sufficient condition for coordinated IN and pure IN for a specific class of relay-aided MIMO-IBC. It is shown that when each BS and user has the minimum antenna configuration, the sufficient and necessary conditions for coordinated IN are the same as the necessary condition for generalized IN. The results provide insight into how to use relay resources efficiently to eliminate interference in both relay-aided MIMO-IBC and relay-aided interference channels.
412245	41224527	Achieving the degrees of freedom of relay-aided interference broadcast channels	This paper examines the degrees of freedom (DoF) of relay-aided interference broadcast channels and the amount of relay resource needed to achieve them. The use of half-duplex relays allows for a G-cell system to achieve GMBS/2 DoF, where MBS is the number of transmit antennas in each cell. By considering interference-free constraints, a lower bound for the required relay resource is derived. To simplify the complex multivariate problem, the authors propose a relaxation technique that results in a linear equation and obtain an achievable bound for the relay resource. The study shows that relay-aided interference broadcast channels require less relay resource compared to relay-aided interference channels, and the transmission protocol used greatly affects the amount of resources needed. 
412246	41224639	Chunk parsing revisited	Chunk parsing is a method used in natural language processing to identify and group words into meaningful units or "chunks". While it has been a theoretically appealing approach, its practical performance has been lacking. However, a new study introduces a simple sliding-window method and maximum entropy classifiers to improve the accuracy and speed of chunk parsing. The results from testing this method on the Penn Treebank corpus show high precision and speed. Additionally, the study proposes a parsing method that considers the probabilities output by the classifiers, which further enhances the accuracy of the parsing. This suggests that chunk parsing can be a viable option for practical use with the right techniques. 
412246	4122468	Bitext Dependency Parsing With Auto-Generated Bilingual Treebank	This paper presents a method to improve the accuracy of bilingual texts (bitexts) dependency parsing by using an auto-generated bilingual treebank created with statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. This approach eliminates the need for costly and troublesome human-annotated bilingual treebanks. The proposed method involves using an SMT system to translate a monolingual treebank into the target language and then using a monolingual parser to parse the translated sentences. To ensure reliable bilingual constraints, an additional step is taken to verify the constraints using unannotated data. The experiments conducted on a standard test data show that this method outperforms monolingual parsers and is robust to noise. This method also eliminates the need for human translation of the test set, making it suitable for purely monolingual settings. Overall, this method provides a more accurate and efficient way to parse bilingual texts.
412246	4122461	Extremely lexicalized models for accurate and fast HPSG parsing	The paper introduces a new probabilistic model for efficient and accurate parsing of HPSG (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar) structures. This model uses probabilities of selecting lexical entries to determine the probabilities of parse trees, making it simpler than previous models. Experimental results show that the proposed model is four times faster and has comparable accuracy to the previous model. Additionally, a hybrid model combining the new probabilistic model with the traditional phrase-structure-based model was developed, which showed even faster speed and higher accuracy compared to the previous model. 
412247	41224788	SimSem: fast approximate string matching in relation to semantic category disambiguation	This study explores the use of fast approximate string matching to address issues with spelling variations and to utilize large-scale lexical resources for semantic class disambiguation. The researchers incorporate string matching results into a machine learning-based disambiguation approach by creating a unique set of features that measure the distance between a given text and the closest match in a collection of lexical resources. They collect these resources from various biomedical sources, resulting in a combined database of over 20 million lexical items. By utilizing a fast and efficient string matching algorithm, the researchers are able to query these resources without significantly impacting system performance. The results are evaluated on six different corpora, showing significant improvements on one corpus while being modest or negative on others. The researchers provide potential explanations for these results and suggest future research directions. Their lexical resources and implementation are available for research purposes at: http://github.com/ninjin/simsem.
412247	4122472	Feature engineering combined with machine learning and rule-based methods for structured information extraction from narrative clinical discharge summaries.	The need for a system that can convert medical text into a structured format is high. The system has three main tasks: concept extraction, assertion classification, and relation identification. The system has five steps: pre-processing, marking phrases, extracting concepts, classifying assertions, and identifying relations. The performance of the system was evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. The results showed that the system is competitive with other state-of-the-art systems. The system uses a variety of features and takes a careful approach to feature engineering. By switching models and using rule-based classifiers, the system was able to improve performance in concept extraction and assertion classification, especially for data-scarce classes. Using a two-staged architecture also significantly improved performance in relation identification.
412247	412247100	Generalising semantic category disambiguation with large lexical resources for fun and profit.	Semantic Category Disambiguation (SCD) is the task of assigning the correct semantic category to a given text span from a predefined set of categories, such as labeling "Fibrin" as a Protein. This is important for Natural Language Processing tasks like Named Entity Recognition, coreference resolution, and coordination resolution. This study focuses on machine learning-based SCD methods that use large lexical resources and approximate string matching, with the goal of generalizing these methods across different domains and data sets. The authors introduce a new method that suggests multiple semantic categories to minimize the number of suggestions while maintaining high recall. This method is evaluated on 15 corpora from various text domains and shows promising results in reducing the number of candidate categories without excluding the correct one. The proposed method can be used as a support tool for manual annotation and as a component in NLP pipelines. The system and related resources are freely available for research purposes.

With the rapid development of personal computers and mobile devices, there has been an increase in computing power and more accurate output through various channels like display and audio. This has also led to the emergence of new ways of interaction for everyday tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of research and development in haptic interaction, which involves touch-based feedback.

412248	41224845	Feedback for Smooth Pursuit Gaze Tracking Based Control.	Smart glasses, like Google Glass or Microsoft HoloLens, have the potential to enhance human abilities in everyday situations. However, traditional manual interactions are not practical with these devices. This is where eye tracking technology, which can be incorporated into the frames of smart glasses, becomes useful. This paper explores the use of different feedback modalities (visual, auditory, haptic, and none) in a continuous adjustment technique for smooth pursuit gaze tracking. This type of gaze tracking allows for spontaneous interactions without the need for calibration. The study found that while there were no significant differences in performance, users preferred and found haptic and audio feedback more acceptable. This research contributes to the understanding of interaction techniques for gaze-aware smart glasses.

Due to their limited ability to use modern computer technology, visually impaired children face challenges in today's society. The software architecture, based on software agents, includes specific support for visual, auditory, and haptic interaction. It has been successfully used with different age groups of visually impaired children. The paper discusses the software technology and interaction techniques used to achieve this goal, as well as the experiences of using the system. The goal of this work is to provide visually impaired children with equal opportunities for learning and participation in technology.
412249	41224936	A New Method For Efficient Symbolic Propagation In Discrete Bayesian Networks	This paper introduces a new method for dealing with uncertainty in discrete Bayesian networks using symbolic expressions instead of numeric calculations. The method involves representing the conditional probabilities of a set of nodes as ratios of linear polynomials in parameters. This allows for efficient computation of the expressions using standard numerical algorithms. An alternative method called the numeric canonical components method is also proposed, which is faster and simpler. Redundancy is avoided by using message-passing methods. The method can also be used to obtain lower and upper bounds for the symbolic expressions. The paper also addresses the issue of symbolic evidence and presents examples to illustrate the methodology.
412249	41224947	Parametric Structure of Probabilities in Bayesian Networks	The paper introduces a method for handling uncertainty in Bayesian networks using symbolic rather than numeric computations. It explains the algebraic structure of probabilities and shows that prior and marginal probabilities can be expressed as rational functions with simple polynomials. It also demonstrates how numeric algorithms can be adapted for symbolic calculations using canonical components and how this can be used to create automatic code generators for symbolic evidence propagation. An example of uncertainty propagation in a clique tree is provided, along with corresponding Mathematica code. The paper also shows that the upper and lower bounds for marginal probabilities can be determined using canonical components.
412249	41224932	Sensitivity analysis in discrete Bayesian networks	The paper introduces a method for efficient sensitivity analysis in discrete Bayesian networks. It utilizes the conditional probabilities of a target node and identifies relevant parameters. These parameters are then reduced based on available evidence, resulting in a smaller subset. By using canonical components associated with this subset, the desired conditional probabilities can be calculated, leading to significant savings in computation. The method can also provide exact upper and lower bounds for the conditional probabilities, making it useful for sensitivity analysis. The paper includes examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. 
412250	4122502	Validating Orchestration of Web Services with BPEL and Aggregate Signatures	This paper presents a framework to ensure integrity and authentication in secure workflow computation using BPEL Web service orchestration. Despite the focus on security for Web services, there is a lack of practical and standardized solutions for securing workflows. The authors propose using aggregate signatures to validate the orchestration, with all partners signing the result of their computation. This method does not require any changes to service implementation and can be applied to linear workflows. A prototype implementation is evaluated for performance and a more general scheme is also proposed for validating generic workflows.
412250	41225038	Improved Security Notions and Protocols for Non-transferable Identification	The paper discusses different security notions for identification protocols, with a focus on non-transferability and physical access by powerful adversaries. The authors introduce a new, strong notion called resettable non-transferable identification, which better reflects real-life scenarios. They also present a generic protocol that satisfies this notion and can be efficiently implemented. The potential applications of this protocol in the next generation of electronic passports are also discussed. The paper highlights the limitations and impossibility results of existing notions and proposes a new achievable one. 
412250	41225042	Steganography Using Modern Arts	This paper proposes a new method for hiding information by utilizing the natural pseudorandomness of certain types of cover-documents. The focus is on embedding binary information into image mosaics, with algorithms that offer varying levels of security. The paper also suggests techniques for minimizing the amount of information that must be stored secretly by users. This approach offers a unique and potentially more secure way of hiding information.
412251	41225137	Agent-Oriented Visual Modeling And Model Validation For Engineering Distributed Systems	Recent Agent-Oriented methodologies for engineering distributed systems follow a model-based approach to software development. This means that they use a specific set of models for each step in the analysis and design phases. To implement this approach effectively, clear guidelines and flexible modeling tools are needed. This paper introduces a modeling environment that integrates an Agent-Oriented modeling tool with other tools, such as a model-checker for verification and a library for graph transformation techniques. The design of this environment follows recommendations from the OMG's Model-Driven Architecture initiative. Examples are provided to illustrate how modeling and validation are supported by this environment.
412251	41225130	Goals at risk? Machine learning at support of early assessment	The process of requirements engineering involves identifying, evaluating, and managing potential risks that could hinder the system from meeting stakeholder needs. However, risk analysis techniques can be time and resource-consuming, adding extra burden to the process. To address this issue, a semi-automated approach is proposed, utilizing existing risk-related information and automated ranking to support risk management. This approach combines knowledge from risk assessment techniques and Machine Learning to involve human evaluators in the decision-making process, continuously learning from their feedback and integrating it with organizational knowledge. The ultimate goal is to enhance an organization's ability to be aware of and manage risks by introducing new interactive and continuous risk management techniques that extract useful knowledge from the organization and decision-maker expertise.
412251	41225138	Gathering Requirements for Software Configuration from the Crowd	Today's software systems are made up of multiple components that work together to provide services to users. To ensure user satisfaction, these systems constantly adapt to their environment and make changes accordingly. One method for designing adaptable software systems is through variability modelling, which involves describing the key components and characteristics of a system and how they can be combined to meet the needs of different users and contexts. However, this process becomes more challenging when dealing with high variability in user profiles. In order to address this issue, the authors suggest using crowdsourcing to gather information about reconfiguration requirements for dynamically adaptive systems. This approach involves input from both potential system users and domain experts in a two-stage process. 
412252	41225236	Shadowed c-means: Integrating fuzzy and rough clustering	A new method of partitive clustering called shadowed clustering has been developed, which uses shadowed sets to reduce computation compared to traditional fuzzy clustering. Unlike rough clustering, the threshold parameter is automatically chosen. The number of clusters is optimized using validity indices. Shadowed clustering can handle overlapping clusters and model uncertainty in class boundaries well, and is robust against outliers. A comparison with other partitive clustering methods shows that this approach is superior, as demonstrated by experiments on both synthetic and real data sets. 
412252	41225253	Shadowed Clustering for Speech Data and Medical Image Segmentation	The paper introduces a new use of the shadowed clustering algorithm for dealing with uncertainty in CT scan image segmentation. By dividing the ambiguity into three zones, the algorithm is able to achieve faster convergence and reduced computational complexity. It is also found to be effective in generating accurate prototypes even in the presence of noise, making it well-suited for unsupervised applications. A comparison with another clustering algorithm shows that the shadowed clustering algorithm does not require external tuning and can automatically determine the threshold. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting regions affected by vascular damage in the brain, and expert radiologists validate its usefulness in diagnosing brain infarctions.
412252	41225219	Rough-fuzzy clustering: an application to medical imagery	This article discusses a new approach to clustering called rough-fuzzy clustering, which has been successfully applied to both synthetic and CT scan images of the brain. This method is able to generate accurate prototypes and handle outliers, while also addressing the issue of overlap between clusters and uncertainty in class boundaries. It automatically determines the optimal number of clusters using validity indices. A comparison with other clustering algorithms is also presented. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application in diagnosing brain infarction in CT scan images, which has been validated by medical experts.
412253	412253105	Evaluation and analysis of term scoring methods for term extraction.	This study evaluates five different methods for automatically extracting terms from four different types of text collections: personal documents, news articles, scientific articles, and medical discharge summaries. Each collection has a specific use case, such as identifying authors, suggesting query terms, and expanding patient queries. The goal is to determine which term scoring method is most suitable for a given collection, and how these methods perform on collections that they were not specifically designed for. The results show that collection size and the presence of multi-word terms are important factors in the success of a term scoring method. The most effective method overall is pointwise Kullback-Leibler divergence for both informativeness and phraseness. This study demonstrates that unsupervised term scoring methods can be applied successfully in a variety of contexts.
412253	41225335	ECIR 2008 Tutorials	This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of advanced language modeling techniques and tools, such as document priors, translation models, and relevance models. It uses expert search as a case study to demonstrate the effects of modeling assumptions. The tutorial is led by Djoerd Hiemstra, an assistant professor at the University of Twente with expertise in information retrieval. Additionally, there are two more tutorials on the topics of search and discovery in user-generated content and building IR applications using the Terrier platform. These tutorials are led by Maarten de Rijke, a professor at the University of Amsterdam, and his PhD student, Wouter Weerkamp, as well as Craig Macdonald, a PhD research student, and Ben He, a post-doctoral research assistant, both from the University of Glasgow. These tutorials offer insights into the challenges and possibilities of accessing and analyzing user-generated content, as well as the design and use of the Terrier platform for IR research and applications.
412253	41225385	Predicting the cost-quality trade-off for information retrieval queries: facilitating database design and query optimization	The integration of full text information retrieval (IR) in a database management system (DBMS) is not a simple task, especially when it comes to query optimization. In order to efficiently process database queries, it is important to have prior knowledge of how to limit the data before executing the query. The imprecise nature of IR allows for a trade-off between data limitation and answer quality. This paper presents a mathematically derived model that can predict the quality implications of neglecting information before query execution. The model can be trained on other document collections and has been validated for various collections, demonstrating its effectiveness.
412254	41225429	The effect of imperfect error detection on reliability assessment via life testing	Life testing is a method used to measure the reliability of software by running it on a large number of test cases and recording the results. The number of failures observed is used to determine the failure probability, even if no failures are observed. However, in practice, failures can occur without being detected. This paper examines the impact of imperfect error detection on the confidence level of the failure probability bound. The results show that imperfect error detection does not necessarily limit the ability of life testing to accurately estimate failure probability in critical systems. However, achieving high confidence levels may require unrealistic assumptions about error detection. Overall, life testing may be more useful for situations where extremely high confidence levels are not necessary.
412254	41225421	Applying hypertext structures to software documentation	Software documentation is crucial for the success of many companies, but it often fails to meet the needs of users due to its static nature. This resource has not been fully utilized and presents challenges in terms of retrieval and integration of different information sources. To address these issues, the University of Virginia is currently working on a prototype system called SLEUTH. This system aims to automate the management of software documentation by using hypertext and typed links for browsing, authoring tools for maintenance, and ad hoc querying for document synthesis. This system has the potential to greatly increase the utility of software documentation for a diverse range of users.
412254	41225462	Software quality through domain-driven certification	Software reuse is a strategy used in software development to increase productivity and improve the quality of the final product. By reusing components from previous projects, the development costs can be amortized and the components can bring their own qualities to the new product. This can result in cost-effective ways to achieve quality without compromising productivity. The term "certified" is sometimes used to describe components that have been tested before being included in a library, but there is no formal definition in the literature. This paper advocates for the development of software through reuse with the specific goal of incorporating required properties into the final product. A precise definition of certification of reusable components is proposed and its benefits in achieving the goal are discussed. 
412255	41225560	Parallel Decomposition of Generalized Series-Parallel Graphs	Generalized series-parallel (GSP) graphs are a type of decomposable graphs that can be represented by their decomposition trees. This allows for efficient solving of graph-theoretic problems. A parallel algorithm has been developed for constructing a decomposition tree of a GSP graph in O(log n) time using C(m, n) processors on a CRCW PRAM. This algorithm relies on the number of processors needed to find connected components of a graph with m edges and n vertices in logarithmic time. Additionally, this algorithm can be used to derive properties for GSP graphs that may be useful in other contexts. 
412255	41225514	A faster implementation of a parallel tree contraction scheme and its application on distance-hereditary graphics	The paper discusses a parallel tree contraction scheme that removes leaves and nodes in maximal chains. The time and processor complexities for computing all nearest smaller values and the minimum of n values are denoted by T(n) and P(n), respectively. The authors present a faster implementation of the tree contraction scheme that takes O(logn·T(n)) time using P(n) processors on an arbitrary CRCW PRAM. This is an improvement over the current best results of O(logloglogn) for T(n) and O(n/logloglogn) for P(n). This implementation can also be used to solve problems on distance-hereditary graphs, with a minimum connected γ-dominating set and a minimum γ-dominating clique being found in O(logn·T(n)) time using O(P(n)+(n+m)/T(n)) processors on an arbitrary CRCW PRAM. This has implications for solving other related problems with the same parallel complexities. 
412255	41225550	Efficient Parallel Algorithms on Distance-Hereditary Graphs	This paper outlines parallel algorithms for finding a minimum weighted independent set, a minimum weighted Steiner tree, and a maximum weighted clique in distance-hereditary graphs. The algorithms take O(\log n) and O(\log^{2} n) time using O(n+m) processors on a CRCW PRAM and a CREW PRAM, respectively. These algorithms improve upon previous methods and offer efficient solutions for these graph problems.
412256	41225685	Data memory minimisation for synchronous data flow graphs emulated on DSP-FPGA targets	 environment for designing and implementing digital signal processing systems on programmable DSP processors and FPGAs. The paper presents an algorithm for determining the smallest possible data buffer sizes for synchronous data flow applications, ensuring a deadlock-free schedule. This is crucial for mapping applications on FPGAs, where there is limited availability of register resources. The algorithm fits into the design flow of GRAPE, making it a valuable tool for efficient DSP system design.
412256	41225616	Data Routing in Dataflow Graphs	A new extension to the cyclo-static dataflow graph model has been proposed, taking into account the significant amount of time and resources spent on data routing in current digital signal processing applications. This model is designed to be used in GRAPE, an environment for rapid prototyping of DSP systems on various target architectures. Examples are provided to clarify the model, and the code generation for data-routing specifications is discussed for a specific synthesis path. The model is validated through a larger example and its implementation. This systematic approach aims to automatically and efficiently synthesize data routing for software or hardware realization.
412256	41225619	Search space definition and exploration for nonuniform data reuse opportunities in data-dominant applications	Efficiently utilizing temporal locality in memory accesses for array signals is crucial for reducing power consumption in embedded data-dominated applications. This can be achieved through an optimized custom memory hierarchy or a customized software-controlled mapping. However, techniques for this design step are limited and have only recently begun to emerge. In this paper, the design space is explored by introducing three parameters that determine the copying between different levels in a hierarchy. This allows for an efficient exploration and cost-effective solutions for the memory size/power trade-off. The effectiveness is demonstrated through real-life image processing algorithms.
412257	41225748	A Clustering Approach to Generalized Tree Alignment with Application to Alu Repeats	The Generalized Tree Alignment Problem is a formalization of the multiple sequence alignment problem that focuses on its evolutionary aspect. It involves finding a phylogenetic tree and ancestral sequences that minimize the amount of change needed to explain the given data. This problem is difficult to solve, but a heuristic algorithm has been developed for it. This algorithm uses a combination of agglomerative clustering techniques and sequence graphs to align the sequences and achieve good results according to the scoring function. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a set of Alu repeats, producing biologically meaningful answers.
412257	4122574	Towards integration of multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree construction.	Molecular evolution relies on reconstructing the history of a group of biological sequences in the form of a phylogenetic tree. This process involves calculating a multiple alignment, which is often treated as a separate problem from tree construction. However, these two tasks are closely linked and can influence each other. A new approach has been developed that simultaneously produces both the tree and multiple alignment by using pre-aligned groups of sequences. This method allows for changes in the alignment during the computation, unlike existing iterative algorithms. A criterion is also implemented to prevent negative edge lengths in the resulting tree. This approach has been successfully applied to aligning protein and nucleic acid sequences. 
412257	41225753	The deferred path heuristic for the generalized tree alignment problem.	Multiple alignment methods aim to minimize the amount of biological change in an alignment by measuring it along a phylogenetic tree, which is often predicted after the alignment. The Generalized Tree Alignment problem addresses this by combining a path heuristic for constructing a Steiner tree with a clustering method. This is achieved using sequence graphs, which efficiently represent similar sequences. While slower than a previous method, the current approach produces better results in terms of the scoring function. An algorithm variant is also introduced that maintains a guaranteed error bound for a specified number of sequences.
412258	41225852	Clustering Large Graphs via the Singular Value Decomposition	The article discusses the problem of dividing a set of points in a multi-dimensional space into a fixed number of clusters, aiming to minimize the total distance between each point and its cluster center. This is the objective of the popular k-means clustering algorithm. The article proves that this problem is difficult to solve even when the number of clusters is only 2. To overcome this difficulty, a continuous relaxation of the problem is considered by finding the best subspace that minimizes the distances of the points to that subspace. This can be efficiently solved using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix representing the points. The article also introduces a fast randomized algorithm for this problem, which can be applied to large-scale applications.
412258	41225819	Topics in matrix sampling algorithms	This article discusses three key problems in Linear Algebra that are crucial for applications in Machine Learning. These include Low-rank Column-based Matrix Approximation, Coreset Construction in Least-Squares Regression, and Feature Selection in K-means Clustering. The main objective of these problems is to select a subset of columns or rows from a given matrix to obtain an approximation or solution that is as good as using all the columns or rows. The authors present new algorithms for these problems, building on previous work in Matrix Sampling Algorithms. Their contributions include improved algorithms for Low-rank Matrix Approximation and Regression, as well as algorithms for a new problem domain – K-means Clustering.
412258	41225855	Faster Least Squares Approximation	Least squares approximation is a method used to find an approximate solution to a system of linear equations that cannot be solved exactly. It is typically used when there are more constraints than variables. Existing methods for finding an exact solution can be time-consuming, taking O(nd^2) time. However, there are two randomized algorithms that can provide accurate approximations to the optimal value and solution vector in a shorter amount of time. These algorithms use the Randomized Hadamard transform to preprocess the data and then randomly sample constraints or perform a sparse random projection to solve the smaller problem. This results in a relative-error approximation that can be computed in O(nd ln d) time if n is significantly larger than d. 
412259	41225920	Comparing two notions of simulatability	This work explores the relationship between two security notions, standard simulatability and universal simulatability, for cryptographic protocols. A protocol is considered secure if every attack on it can be simulated by an idealized version of the protocol. Two common formalizations of this concept are standard simulatability, which requires that no user can distinguish the protocol from the idealized version, and universal simulatability, which allows for a single user to distinguish. It is shown that universal simulatability implies standard simulatability for perfect security, but not for computational or statistical security. Additionally, a formal definition of a time-lock puzzle is presented, which has implications for the separation of standard and universal simulatability in terms of computational security.
412259	41225918	On the notion of statistical security in simulatability definitions	We explore the concept of statistical security in the context of reactive simulatability, a framework for analyzing multi-party protocols. However, we find that the current definition of statistical security in this framework does not allow for secure composition of protocols. We propose a modified notion of statistical security that does allow for secure composition and provide evidence that the previous lack of composability was due to the specific formulation of statistical security. This revised definition can also be applied to Canetti's universal composability framework, potentially preventing similar issues. 
412259	41225925	Conditional reactive simulatability	Simulatability is an important concept in the security of cryptographic protocols, as it guarantees strong security and compositionality by taking into account all possible environmental behaviors. However, this means that protocols that are secure except for specific behaviors cannot be considered simulatable, even if those behaviors can be easily identified and prevented. To address this issue, a more flexible approach is proposed where the permitted environmental behaviors are explicitly stated. This results in a more achievable and cost-effective security definition for certain protocols. Although this approach may compromise unconditional composability, it is shown that the composition of conditionally simulatable protocols can still result in simulatable protocols, even in cases of cyclic assume-guarantee conditions. Additionally, this approach can be applied to commonly used protocol classes to achieve simulatability in the traditional sense.
412260	41226046	Hot or not: Interactive content search using comparisons	The article discusses a method for searching for a specific object in a database using interactive content search through comparisons. The user is asked to select the most similar object from a small list, and then a new list is presented based on her previous selections. This process continues until the target object is included in the list, and the search terminates. The study focuses on the scenario of heterogeneous demand, where target objects are selected from a non-uniform probability distribution. The proposed algorithm uses a doubling metric space and can efficiently search for objects with a cost proportional to the doubling constant and the entropy of the demand distribution. The average search cost is shown to scale with a bound of O(c5H), which is an improvement from previous bounds and is order optimal for a constant c.
412260	41226045	Content search through comparisons	The article discusses the issue of navigating through a database of similar objects using comparisons when there is a diverse demand for these objects. This problem is similar to designing small-world networks. It is proven that this problem is NP-hard, leading to the proposal of a new mechanism for small-world network design. The mechanism's performance is bounded under heterogeneous demand. The mechanism also has an equivalent application in content search through comparisons, which leads to the establishment of both upper and lower bounds on this type of search.
412260	41226052	Comparison-Based Learning with Rank Nets	In this study, the problem of search through comparisons is examined, where a user is given two options and must determine which is closer to their intended target. Adaptive strategies are explored that rely on rank relationships rather than actual distances between objects. The authors propose a new strategy, rank nets, which shows promising results for target distributions with a bounded doubling constant. This strategy requires a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution, making it comparable to the optimum. The study also considers the effects of noisy oracles and compares this new strategy to previous methods using multiple datasets.
412261	41226154	Robust graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization for clustering.	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and its graph regularized extensions have been popular in machine learning and data mining. However, they are prone to errors and noise due to the use of squared loss function in measuring graph regularization and data reconstruction. To address this issue, a new robust graph regularized NMF model (RGNMF) is proposed. It assumes that there may be corrupted data entries, but the corruption is sparse. An error matrix is introduced to capture this sparse corruption, resulting in a more accurate factorization of the data. Additionally, the use of -norm function helps to reduce the impact of unreliable regularization errors. An iterative updating algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem, and experimental results show that RGNMF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
412261	4122618	Feature selection for imbalanced data based on neighborhood rough sets.	Feature selection is a crucial step in data mining that involves choosing the most relevant features to create a more effective learning model and save time and memory. Imbalanced data is common in real-life applications such as medical diagnoses, intrusion detection, and credit ratings, making feature selection for imbalanced data an important area of research. In this study, the authors propose a method for feature selection using neighborhood rough set theory, which takes into account the uneven distribution of classes. The method uses a discernibility-matrix-based feature selection technique and a novel algorithm called RSFSAID. The authors also investigate the impact of different parameters on feature selection and use a particle swarm optimization algorithm to determine the optimal parameters. The results of experiments on public datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms four other algorithms in terms of classification performance for imbalanced data.
412261	41226127	Feature Selection Considering Multiple Correlations Based on Soft Fuzzy Dominance Rough Sets for Monotonic Classification	Monotonic classification is a common task in multicriteria decision-making, where features and decisions must adhere to a monotonic constraint. The dominance-based rough set theory is a useful tool for acquiring knowledge in these tasks, but existing models are sensitive to noise and can lead to large errors. Additionally, most feature selection methods for monotonic classification only consider the relevance between features and decisions, ignoring important multiple correlations. To address these issues, a robust fuzzy dominance rough set model is proposed, along with a feature selection method that takes into account multiple correlations. This method is shown to have excellent classification performance in experiments on 12 public datasets.
412262	41226234	Algorithmic Barriers from Phase Transitions	In many random constraint satisfaction problems, there are tight estimates for the largest constraint density for which solutions exist. However, known polynomial-time algorithms for these problems stop finding solutions at much lower densities. For example, coloring a random graph requires twice as many colors as its chromatic number, which has yet to be improved upon despite efforts from researchers. This "resilience" of the factor of 2 against algorithms is explored by analyzing the evolution of the set of k-colorings of a random graph. The factor of 2 is shown to correspond to a phase transition in the geometry of the set, and this phenomenon is also observed in other random CSPs. A general technique is developed to prove this using statistical physics principles.
412262	41226246	Why almost all k-colorable graphs are easy	Coloring a k-colorable graph using k colors (k ≥ 3) is a difficult problem, but considering average case analysis can lead to better outcomes. This study focuses on the uniform distribution over k-colorable graphs with n vertices and cn edges, where c is a sufficiently large constant. The researchers rigorously prove that most of these graphs have proper k-colorings that are clustered in one group, with only a small number of vertices having different colors. They also present a polynomial time algorithm that can find a proper k-coloring for the majority of these random graphs, indicating that they are mostly "easy" to color. This is in contrast to very sparse random graphs, where experimental results suggest that certain edge densities are challenging for many coloring methods. The explanation for this is that the solution space for these graphs is more complex and "clustering", as supported by statistical physics analysis. This study provides a rigorous confirmation of this explanation.
412262	4122621	Local convergence of random graph colorings.	The article discusses the properties of a random graph G(n, m) with an average degree d = 2m/n below the k-colorability threshold. It considers the correlations between colors assigned to far apart vertices in a uniformly random k-coloring of G. According to a prediction from statistical physics, for average degrees below the condensation threshold dk,cond, the colors assigned to these distant vertices are independent. The article proves this conjecture for k exceeding a certain constant k0 and explores the joint distribution of k-colorings induced by a fixed number of vertices. It also discusses the implications on the reconstruction problem.
412263	41226361	Dynamic frequency scaling algorithms for improving the CPU's energy efficiency	This paper focuses on improving the energy efficiency of service center server CPUs by using dynamic frequency scaling to balance computational performance and power consumption. Two algorithms, an immune inspired algorithm and a fuzzy logic based algorithm, were created and tested. The immune inspired algorithm uses a model based on human antigens to classify the server's power/performance state and determine actions to optimize power consumption. The fuzzy logic algorithm adjusts the CPU's performance based on workload, while also filtering workload spikes to avoid excessive p-state transitions. These techniques aim to reduce the overall energy consumption of service center server CPUs.
412263	41226381	A reinforcement learning based self-healing algorithm for managing context adaptation	This paper proposes a self-healing model for addressing context adaptation. The model uses reinforcement learning to make decisions at runtime and ensures self-healing by monitoring the system's execution environment and selecting appropriate healing actions. The reinforcement learning approach is used to select the best sequence of actions to maintain context resources in a policy-compliant state. This model aims to improve the system's ability to adapt to changing contexts and maintain a desired level of performance. 
412263	41226385	On Analyzing Elasticity Relationships of Cloud Services	The rise in popularity of cloud computing has led to the development of elastic cloud services, which are made up of different units spread across multiple virtual machines and containers in various clouds. However, due to the complexity of software stacks and deployment processes, there is a lack of tools and techniques for understanding the relationships between these units and how they impact the overall elasticity of the service. This paper aims to address this issue by characterizing these relationships and developing mechanisms for analyzing them using service monitoring data and elasticity requirements. The proposed approach was tested through experiments with an elastic data service for M2M platforms, demonstrating the importance of understanding elasticity relationships for the successful development and operation of elastic services.
412264	41226459	Clustering Sparse Graphs.	The development of a new algorithm for clustering sparse unweighted graphs is presented. The goal is to partition nodes into clusters with high density within clusters and low density across clusters. This is challenging due to the small edge densities within and across clusters. The algorithm takes into account the noisiness of sparse graphs and uses a different penalization approach for missing edges within clusters and present edges across clusters. It is tested on the well-known "planted partition" model and is shown to outperform previous methods in terms of clustering sparser graphs with smaller clusters. This is also supported by empirical evidence.
412264	41226437	Matrix Completion With Column Manipulation: Near-Optimal Sample-Robustness-Rank Tradeoffs	This paper addresses the issue of matrix completion when some columns are corrupted by a malicious adversary. Existing algorithms for matrix completion can perform poorly when even a single column is corrupted. This problem arises in robust collaborative filtering, where certain users manipulate the system to skew predictions. The paper proposes a new algorithm that combines a trimming procedure and a convex program to minimize the nuclear and $ell _{1,2}$ norms. The theoretical results show that the algorithm can complete the matrix even with a growing number of corrupted columns, without assuming anything about the locations or values of the manipulated columns. These results are nearly optimal and provide insights into the tradeoffs between sample size, robustness, and rank in matrix completion.
412264	41226470	Iterative and Active Graph Clustering Using Trace Norm Minimization Without Cluster Size Constraints	This paper discusses the planted partition model in graph clustering and investigates the impact of small clusters on the recovery of larger clusters. While traditional results suggest that all clusters must be large enough for successful recovery, the authors demonstrate through a refined analysis that this is not always necessary. They propose an iterative algorithm that follows a "peeling strategy" to recover the large clusters first and then address the smaller ones. This approach is also extended to the partial observation setting, where only a portion of the graph is observed. The authors suggest that this iterative peeling strategy can be applied in other contexts beyond the specific methods used in this paper. 
412265	41226568	Personalized recommendation of social software items based on social relations	This study focuses on personalized recommendations for social software items such as web-pages, blog entries, and communities. The recommendations are based on the user's social network information, which is collected from different sources within the organization. The research compares the effectiveness of recommendations based on the user's familiarity network and their similarity network. Additionally, the impact of providing explanations for recommended items, including related people and their relationship to the user and the item, is also examined. Results from a user survey and a field study suggest that recommendations based on the familiarity network are more effective and that providing explanations can increase interest in recommended items. 
412265	41226524	Personalized social search based on the user's social network	This research focuses on personalized social search, where search results are customized based on the user's social connections. Three types of social networks are studied for personalization: familiarity-based, similarity-based, and overall networks. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated through an offline study and a user survey within the organization. Results show that social network-based personalization is more effective than non-personalized social search, and all three social network strategies outperform a topic-based personalization approach. This is supported by both the offline study and user survey, where participants exposed to the different personalization strategies showed a preference for social network-based methods.
412265	41226510	Social search and discovery using a unified approach	This research focuses on enhancing the search and discovery of relationships between Web 2.0 entities by incorporating different types and sources of social information. The aim is to enable the search for various types of objects, such as documents, people, and tags, while also retrieving related objects of all types. The researchers developed a social-search engine that uses a unified approach to expand the search space and represent diverse information objects that are connected by various types of relationships. This approach also allows for efficient updates and searches over the heterogeneous data. The study was conducted within a large enterprise and involved a user study with 600 participants, which showed that social data significantly improves search precision and is closely related to the retrieved topics.
412266	41226624	Characterizing VeSFET-Based ICs With CMOS-Oriented EDA Infrastructure	This paper discusses the application of standard cell design methodology to create vertical slit field effect transistor (VeSFET)-based ASICs using modern CMOS EDA tools. The study focuses on a family of VeSFET canvases, specifically chain canvases, that offer improved performance and power consumption compared to circuits using isolated transistor canvases. The designs were compared to those implemented with a commercial low power CMOS library and corresponding VeSFET libraries. Results showed significant power reduction in VeSFET-based designs compared to CMOS-based designs with the same performance. This highlights the potential for VeSFETs to be a promising alternative to CMOS technology in ASIC design.
412266	41226632	Iddq Testing for High Performance CMOS - The Next Ten Years	CMOS scaling, which involves reducing the size of transistors on integrated circuits, has a direct impact on the subthreshold current and the effectiveness of Iddq testing. This trend is expected to continue for at least the next ten years, with a factor of 2**(1/2) reduction in line widths every three years and an increase in chip size leading to a 2-3 times increase in the number of transistors per IC. However, this also affects various device parameters, including the leakage current, which can make it challenging to distinguish between good and defective devices using Iddq testing if defect size also scales with technology.
412266	41226616	Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistor in ultra-low power applications	VeSFETs are innovative transistors made using SOI technology with twin gates and no junction, resulting in nearly perfect sub-threshold swing. They have been evaluated as potential components for ultra-low power circuits and compared to FinFETs and bulk-MOSFETs in a 65nm technology. Experiments show that VeSFETs have the smallest capacitance and lowest minimum energy compared to the other devices. A VeSFET-based circuit with tied gates is found to have lower energy and higher frequency than one with independent gates. However, for extremely low and wide frequency ranges, the independent gate VeSFET performs better in terms of energy efficiency.
412267	41226726	Event-Triggered Optimal Control With Performance Guarantees Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming.	This paper focuses on event-triggered optimal control (ETOC) for continuous-time nonlinear systems. A new event-triggering condition is proposed, which allows for the design of ETOC methods based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Performance guarantees are provided through upper and lower bounds. An adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method is developed using a critic neural network (NN) to approximate the value function of the HJB equation. It is proven that semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness can be achieved for states and NN weight errors with the ADP-based ETOC. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this method.
412267	41226721	DRS: Dynamic Resource Scheduling for Real-Time Analytics over Fast Streams	A data stream management system (DSMS) allows users to register continuous queries and receive result updates in real-time. This is particularly important for applications with time constraints, where results must be received within a given period. To handle the fast data, DSMSs are often placed on top of a cloud infrastructure. However, due to unpredictable fluctuations in stream properties, cloud resources must be dynamically provisioned and scheduled to ensure real-time response. The proposed solution, DRS, is a dynamic resource scheduler for cloud-based DSMSs. It addresses challenges such as accurately modeling the relationship between resources and response time, determining the best resource placement, and measuring system load with minimal overhead. DRS has been tested with real data and has shown to achieve real-time response with optimal resource consumption.
412267	41226727	Design and Implementation of a Real-Time Interactive Analytics System for Large Spatio-Temporal Data.	OceanRT is a real-time interactive data analytics system designed to handle large amounts of spatio-temporal data, such as call logs and mobile web browsing records. It runs on cloud infrastructure and utilizes software RDMA one-sided operations to reduce networking costs. Additionally, it employs a novel architecture with Access-Query Engines (AQEs) to take advantage of parallel computing capabilities in the cloud. Its storage scheme is optimized for queries with joins and multi-dimensional selections, which are common in large spatio-temporal data. In experiments, OceanRT has been shown to outperform existing systems by more than an order of magnitude in terms of speed.
412268	41226826	Automatic metadata generation for active measurement.	The Internet is a challenging environment for conducting empirical research due to potential bias introduced by local conditions such as CPU or network load. In response, the authors propose a framework for local environment monitoring during Internet measurement experiments. This framework aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of measurement results and increase the reproducibility of findings. The tool SoMeta is used to implement this framework and evaluate its runtime costs. Through a series of intentional perturbations of the local environment during active probe-based measurements, the authors demonstrate how simple local monitoring can reveal biases in the results. They also discuss the potential for expanding this framework to provide metadata for a wider range of Internet measurement experiments. 
412268	41226852	Scalable Network Path Emulation	As network research becomes more popular, laboratory-based experimentation has emerged as a useful method for evaluating network systems and protocols. To accurately replicate real-world conditions, it is important to create paths between nodes in the lab that mimic those in the Internet. This paper introduces NetPath, a software-based path emulation tool that offers various features such as packet delay, errors, loss, duplication, and reordering. Through experiments, NetPath has been shown to have a higher throughput capacity and precision compared to other software-based emulators. It also improves application traffic behavior and allows for simultaneous path emulation on multiple physical links, making more efficient use of laboratory resources. 
412268	41226843	On The Performance Of Round Trip Time Network Tomography	Network tomography is a method used to measure link level characteristics in a network, such as delay and loss. However, existing techniques often require collaboration from both sending and receiving hosts, limiting their applicability. The authors propose Network Radar, a new tomographic inference method based on round trip time (RTT) measurements from TCP SYN/SYN-ACK packets. They extend their previous work to include confidence estimates and evaluate the method in both controlled laboratory experiments and real-world tests. Results show that Network Radar can accurately estimate delay variance and identify network topology, making it useful for research and operational purposes.
412269	412269248	Stable Delaunay Graphs.	The concept of stability of edges in a Euclidean Delaunay triangulation is introduced, with a parameter $$\\alpha$$ being used to determine if an edge is $$\\alpha$$-stable. A subgraph G is defined as a $$(c\\alpha, \\alpha)$$-stable Delaunay graph if every edge in G is $$\\alpha$$-stable and every $$c\\alpha$$-stable edge in the triangulation is also in G. This concept can also be applied to Delaunay triangulations under different convex distance functions. It is shown that if an edge is stable in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation, it is also stable in the triangulation under a different distance function, and vice-versa. This relationship leads to a linear-size kinetic data structure for maintaining a $$(8\\alpha, \\alpha)$$-stable Delaunay graph as points move, with a time complexity of $$O(\\log n)$$ for each event during the motion. It is also shown that many properties of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation are retained in any stable Delaunay graph.
412269	412269290	Kinetic Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations under Polygonal Distance Functions.	This study analyzes the changes in the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation of a set of points as they move along continuous trajectories, using a convex distance function defined by a convex k-gon. Assuming bounded degree algebraic trajectories for the points, an upper bound of \(O(k^4n\lambda _r(n))\) is established for the number of topological changes in the diagrams. The maximum length of an (n, r)-Davenport–Schinzel sequence, \(\lambda _r(n)\), is also considered, with r being a constant based on the algebraic degree of the point motion. An algorithm is proposed for efficiently maintaining the structures, utilizing the kinetic data structure (KDS) framework.
412269	4122695	Geometrically aware communication in random wireless networks	The Delaunay triangulation of a wireless network's nodes was initially used as a routing algorithm for position-aware wireless networks. However, it was later deemed impractical due to the potential for long edges and the need for a global view of the network. Other algorithms were proposed, assuming random node placement, but it was found that the Delaunay triangulation was still effective when nodes were uniformly placed in a unit disk. Geometric analysis showed that the maximal length of an edge in this scenario was O(3√3log novern) and the expected sum of squares of all edges was O(1). This makes computing the Delaunay triangulation locally easy and efficient for routing and flooding in wireless networks. It is also optimal for geocasting due to its spanner property.
412270	41227015	Software-directed power-aware interconnection networks	Interconnection networks are used in various parallel computer systems, but recent technology trends have led to increased power consumption. Power-aware networks are needed to address this issue, but current techniques are limited and not tailored to specific applications. Research on power-aware parallelizing compilers is also in its early stages. In this paper, the authors propose software techniques that allow for dynamic voltage scaling of network links during application runtime, based on offline DVS settings generated during static compilation. Simulations show that this approach can reduce link power consumption by up to 76.3&percnt;, with minimal impact on network performance.
412270	41227082	Dynamic Voltage Scaling with Links for Power Optimization of Interconnection Networks	Interconnection networks, originally designed for multicomputers, have mainly focused on performance. However, as they are now being used in various applications, power efficiency has become a crucial factor. As the demand for network bandwidth increases, communication links consume a significant amount of power, making it necessary to consider dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) to minimize power consumption. A history-based DVS policy is proposed, which adjusts link frequencies and voltages based on past utilization, resulting in up to 6.3X power savings and a moderate impact on performance. This is the first study to target dynamic power optimization of interconnection networks.
412270	41227080	Dynamic Power Management For Power Optimization Of Interconnection Networks Using On/Off Links	The increasing use of interconnection networks has raised concerns about power consumption. These networks, which connect routers, consume a significant amount of power and will continue to do so as bandwidth and operating frequencies increase. To address this issue, a dynamic power management policy is proposed where network links are turned on and off based on network utilization. This method uses a connectivity graph to balance power and performance for a 2D mesh topology and is combined with a deadlock-free, fully-adaptive routing algorithm for guaranteed packet delivery. This approach results in a 37.5% reduction in network link power for an 8-ary 2-mesh topology with a moderate increase in network latency.
412271	4122711	Feature selection for ensembles applied to handwriting recognition	The use of feature selection in creating ensembles has been proven to be an effective strategy due to its ability to produce high-quality subsets of features. This paper introduces a new approach to ensemble feature selection using a hierarchical multi-objective genetic algorithm. The algorithm operates in two levels, first selecting features to generate a set of classifiers and then choosing the best team of classifiers. It has been tested in both supervised and unsupervised feature selection scenarios, specifically in the recognition of handwritten digits and month words. Comparisons with traditional methods such as Bagging and Boosting showed that this approach leads to significant improvements in low error rate situations. These improvements are demonstrated through recognition rate comparisons.
412271	41227111	Zoning and metaclasses for character recognition	This paper has two main contributions. First, it explores the use of confusion matrices to determine perceptual zoning for character recognition. The study focuses on concavities and convexities deficiencies in the background pixels of the input image, and discusses four different types of zoning. Results suggest that this method could be a viable alternative to exhaustive search algorithms. The second contribution is the development of a methodology for defining metaclasses in handwritten character recognition. This approach uses disagreement among characters and calculates the Euclidean distance between confusion matrices. Experiments show that using metaclasses can enhance the performance of the system.
412271	41227127	Metaclasses and Zoning Mechanism Applied to Handwriting Recognition	This paper presents two contributions to the field of character recognition. The first is the use of confusion matrices to define perceptual zoning, using features based on concavities and convexities. Experiments show that this method can be a viable alternative to exhaustive search algorithms. The second contribution is a methodology for defining metaclasses in handwritten character recognition, based on disagreement among characters and using Euclidean distance between confusion matrices. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating metaclasses can improve the system's performance. 
412272	41227243	Using Context Similarity for Service Recommendation	Recommender systems have been successful in solving the issue of information overload for consumers by providing recommendations for goods and services. However, existing systems for service recommendation do not consider both service qualities and contextual dimensions simultaneously. To address this gap, a new approach is proposed that combines both criteria using concept abduction as a reliable measure for context similarity. This approach aims to improve the effectiveness of recommendations in situations with limited feedback. Experiments using real-world data demonstrate the usefulness of this method in addressing data sparsity by incorporating rankings from nearby context segments.
412272	41227226	A Framework for the Evaluation of Mashup Tools	Mashup Programming is a popular method of creating web applications, but it is still considered to be in its early stages. In order to better understand the support available for end users in mashup development, a multi-dimensional framework is proposed to evaluate existing tools and platforms. The evaluation focuses on the end-user perspective and considers factors such as capturing users' requirements and goals. The study also covers platforms that have not been previously evaluated. The framework can be used to guide future research and design of mashup development environments. The study highlights the need for a more user-oriented approach in mashup programming and suggests the use of users' goals as a guiding mechanism in creating mashup applications.
412272	41227249	A framework for classifying intelligent design theories	Software Engineering (SE) design approaches are typically based on procedural and object-oriented paradigms, using methods and techniques for abstraction, modularity, and refinement of software functionality. However, other engineering fields have developed theories of Intelligent Design (ID) to explain the design process of human engineers. These theories have been applied to designing complex artifacts and may have potential in supporting SE design. To evaluate the effectiveness of ID theories in SE design, a systematic framework is needed to analyze and classify the different elements of these theories. This paper proposes a framework that includes research approach, process models, and knowledge representations as main elements of ID theories. It also suggests using appraisal criteria to assess the usefulness of each theory in supporting SE design activities.
412273	4122737	Mobile access to cultural heritage: mobile-CH 2016.	The Mobile-CH workshop, taking place alongside the MOBILE HCI Conference, will serve as a platform for the intersection of cultural heritage research and personalization using technology, particularly mobile and ubiquitous devices. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on cultural heritage to explore the potential of cutting-edge technology in enhancing the experience at heritage sites. The outcome of the workshop will be a collaborative research agenda that will guide future research and encourage partnerships among different disciplines.
412273	41227349	Thematic Maps for Geographical Information Search.	The challenge of exploring cultural heritage information is hindered by fragmented data and a focus on specific repositories or applications. To overcome this, a data integration approach is necessary to generate custom views tailored to the user's needs but also expandable to related content. This paper introduces a model for managing thematic maps and integrating them with query expansion during user interaction. The model is based on an ontological representation of domain knowledge and a semantic interpretation model for identifying concepts in user queries. The model is being tested in the OnToMap Participatory GIS, a platform for interactive community maps and decision-making.
412273	41227335	A configurable system for the construction of adaptive virtual stores	The Internet has led to an increase in electronic sales, resulting in the development of tools for setting up web stores. However, these tools often do not focus on personalizing the interaction with customers. This is important as customers have diverse needs and preferences, and marketing strategies are increasingly tailored to specific buyers. To address this, the authors describe a virtual web store with a configurable architecture that uses user modeling techniques to create a profile and tailor product descriptions and recommendations. The system is based on a multiagent architecture and separates domain-dependent knowledge from domain-independent components, making it easily adaptable to different sales domains. The system is developed in Java and includes a prototype store and configuration tools for setting up new stores.
412274	41227448	Coping with WORDNET Sense Proliferation	WORDNET is renowned for its detailed word sense distinctions, but this can pose a challenge for computational tasks like word sense disambiguation. In order to address this issue, one approach is to reduce the number of senses by grouping them into equivalence classes. However, the authors of this paper propose a different approach. They acknowledge that some of the sense distinctions in WORDNET may be questionable, but they prefer to maintain its semantic richness and instead suggest extensions to make word sense disambiguation more manageable.
412274	41227437	Context-Aware Workflow Management	The CAWE framework is a tool for managing context-aware workflow systems using Web Services. It allows for a flexible and extensible specification of context-sensitive workflows, which can be executed by standard workflow engines. The framework was used to develop a prototype application for monitoring patients on blood thinners. CAWE is based on a hierarchical workflow representation and a declarative specification of conditions for selecting the appropriate workflow. A prototype system was developed and tested with medical workflows involving human actors. The resulting medical application can be accessed through the internet on a PC or Smart Phone and supports the coordination of activities for patients with heart diseases.

A case study in the telecommunication industry is presented, showcasing how a generic framework for customer-adaptive distributed online configuration supports the offering and selling of complex products and services. The concept of mass customization, where products and services are sold in various variants according to customer needs, is emphasized. The importance of customer interaction in a web-based environment is highlighted, with the suggestion of a personalized web interaction to imitate a knowledgeable salesperson. The increasing trend towards a digital economy in the 21st century is also discussed, with a focus on the need for flexible integration and distributed knowledge bases in configuration technology. The developed framework is applicable to other industries with similar requirements for electronic commerce systems, such as facility management and building and construction.
412275	41227582	Capacity Theorems for Distributed Index Coding	Index coding is a communication method in which a server sends messages and their respective receivers use side information to reduce the amount of communication needed. Distributed index coding is an extension of this, where multiple servers broadcast different subsets of messages. This paper studies the optimal tradeoff between message and server broadcast rates, known as the capacity region, for a general distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are established, with matching sum-rates for various scenarios. The proposed inner bound uses a distributed composite coding scheme, while the outer bound is based on the polymatroidal axioms of entropy and functional dependences. These bounds improve upon existing ones and have features demonstrated through examples.
412275	41227567	Chop and roll: Improving the cutset bound	A new outer bound has been established for the capacity region of a general noisy network with multiple messages. This bound is based on an ordered partition of the nodes in the network and can be interpreted as the directed information between inputs and outputs across these subsets. It is a generalization of existing bounds for specific types of networks, such as graphical and Gaussian networks. The new bound improves upon the standard cutset bound, especially in simple examples. 
412275	4122750	Index coding via random coding	The index coding problem is a distributed source coding problem that arises in various applications and involves broadcasting multiple messages to receivers with side information. It is also a fundamental instance of the multiple-unicast network coding problem and has been extensively studied. This paper focuses on the composite coding scheme based on random coding, which has been shown to outperform existing coding schemes and is optimal for problems with up to five messages. The scheme is simple and allows for straightforward analysis, making it a powerful tool in solving the index coding problem. Various coding schemes have been proposed, utilizing concepts from graph theory, linear network coding, combinatorial optimization, and interference alignment. 
412276	412276112	Coalitional Games for Transmitter Cooperation in MIMO Multiple Access Channels	Wireless networks rely on cooperation between nodes to achieve higher throughputs. This paper focuses on determining the feasibility and stability of cooperation between rational nodes in a wireless network using cooperative game theory. The stability of the grand coalition of transmitters is examined, taking into account external interference and different receiver strategies. The core of the game is used to determine stability, which is a complex problem. Results show that cooperation is stable for a single user decoding receiver, but unstable for an interference cancelling receiver with a fixed decoding order. However, allowing for time sharing between decoding orders can make cooperation stable at high signal-to-noise ratios. This research highlights the importance of cooperation in wireless networks and its potential to improve individual user rates.
412276	412276114	Minimizing sum distortion for static and mobile fusion center placement in underwater sensor networks.	Optimizing the position of a mobile fusion center in a sensor network is a significant problem, with the goal of minimizing the sum distortion in communication between nodes and the fusion center. The study incorporates a time-multiplexing architecture for communication between nodes and the fusion center, as well as transmission losses along underwater links. Utilizing information theory results, the optimization problem is formulated and solved analytically for a fixed fusion center location and numerically for a mobile fusion center. In the low power regime, the fusion center selectively communicates with a few nodes while turning others off, and in the high power regime, the time allocated to nodes is based on their information content and distance to the fusion center. When the fusion center is mobile, it is placed near the node with the most information in the low power regime, but this difference decreases as power increases.
412276	412276107	Complexity constrained sensor networks: achievable rates for two relay networks and generalizations	This study examines the effect of computational limitations on the communication efficiency of sensor networks. The nodes in these networks are assumed to have limited processing abilities and can only use a small portion of their processor time to relay information. The amount of processor time donated is determined by the node's ability to reliably decode a channel code at a given rate. The study focuses on a four node network with two relays and builds upon previous work for a complexity constrained single relay network. The proposed coding scheme involves the transmitter sending a broadcast code that allows the relays to decode only the necessary information, and assists the receiver in removing ambiguity. The impact of different power constraints on the system is explored through numerical examples, considering both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels. As the complexity bound increases, the proposed scheme aligns with a previously proposed achievable rate.
412277	41227752	A theory of the motion fields of curves	This article discusses a study on the motion field generated by moving 3-D curves observed by a camera. The relationship between optical flow and motion field is explored, showing that the assumptions made in computing optical flow are difficult to defend. The motion field of a nonrigid curve is then studied, introducing the concept of isometric motion and analyzing the spatiotemporal surface and its differential properties. It is shown that the full motion field of a curve cannot be recovered from this surface, but equations can be used to characterize it up to a rigid transformation. The study also examines the use of two cameras for disambiguating stereo correspondences.
412277	41227717	The fundamental matrix: Theory, algorithms, and stability analysis	This paper examines the geometry of a pair of cameras (stereo rig) by not assuming known intrinsic parameters. This is more realistic and captures necessary information for establishing correspondences between images. The commonly used Essential matrix is confusing and this paper introduces the Fundamental matrix, a 3x3 matrix of rank 2, to clarify the projective nature of the correspondence problem in stereo.
412277	412277112	A comparison of projective reconstruction methods for pairs of views	Uncalibrated stereo reconstruction from multiple views has become possible with the development of different approaches. These methods use weak calibration, based on epipolar geometry, and do not require any knowledge of camera parameters. This paper compares various available techniques for projective reconstruction from pairs of views. Projective stereo algorithms can be divided into two categories based on how they compute 3D coordinates. The first category involves explicit computation of camera matrices, while the second category uses implicit image measurements and invariants based on the Cayley algebra and cross ratios. The stabilities of these methods are evaluated using synthetic and real images, which helps in determining their usefulness for 3D uncalibrated reconstruction in practical applications.
412278	41227857	The First International Workshop on Non-Functional System Properties in Domain Specific Modeling Languages (NFPinDSML2008)	The workshop aimed to bring together researchers and practitioners from different fields to discuss the integration of non-functional properties in software systems. This included those from language engineering and experts in Domain Specific Modeling Languages. The focus was on expanding the principles of reasoning about non-functional properties in software systems and model-driven engineering. 
412278	41227824	Model-Driven Performance Evaluation for Service Engineering	Service engineering and service-oriented architecture are modern methods for integrating software systems. In this approach, performance is a key factor in the integration of diverse, distributed service-based systems. To ensure software quality, empirical performance evaluation is used to measure and calculate performance metrics. This involves testing the implemented software to determine its efficiency. A model-driven service engineering approach is presented for empirical performance evaluation of services and service compositions. This approach utilizes temporal databases theory to evaluate the performance of service systems developed using a model-driven approach. Overall, this method helps to ensure the quality and efficiency of service-based systems.
412278	41227875	Observation and abstract behaviour in specification and implementation of state-based systems	Classical algebraic specification is a widely used method for specifying software, but it has been criticized for not considering the concept of state, which is important in most programming languages. In response, a new approach has been proposed that uses algebraic methods to formalize the idea of state-based objects or abstract machines. Unlike other similar approaches, this one uses dynamic logic instead of equational logic, which allows for more expressive specifications and the ability to specify safety and liveness conditions. This also allows for a clearer distinction between functional and state-based parts of a system, which is crucial for achieving behavioral abstraction when needed. The focus is on abstract behavior and observation, and a behavioral notion of satisfaction is used to abstract from irrelevant details of the state realization. 
412279	41227949	Feature Curve Metric for Image Classification	The paper introduces a new classifier, called the feature cure metric (FCM) which combines elements from existing classifiers for hand gesture and face recognition. It uses a distance metric between the test sample and prototype samples to improve accuracy. Experiments on various databases show that FCM outperforms other well-known classifiers, such as nearest neighbor, nearest feature line, and center-based nearest neighbor. The proposed approach achieves higher recognition rates on Jochen Triesch Static Hand Posture, Yale face, and JAFFE face databases.
412279	41227950	Two Classifiers Based on Nearest Feature Plane for Recognition	This paper introduces two improved methods, CNFP and LNFP, for recognition based on the nearest feature plane (NFP) approach. These methods incorporate concepts from the nearest neighbor plane (NNP) and center-based nearest neighbor (CNN) classifiers to reduce computational complexity and improve performance compared to the NFP classifier. Experiments on Yale face database and soil object database show that CNFP and LNFP outperform other improved classifiers in terms of both computational complexity and recognition rate.
412279	41227919	Feature extraction based on nearest feature line and compressive sensing	This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm that combines nearest feature line and compressive sensing. By transforming the prototype samples into the compressive sensing domain and using the Neighborhood discriminant nearest feature line analysis (NDNFLA) method, the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity while maintaining a high recognition rate. The algorithm is tested on the AR face Database for image classification and shows promising results. This suggests that the proposed algorithm is effective in feature extraction and can be applied to various tasks. 
412280	4122803	An event based approach to web service design and interaction	The paper proposes a new approach to web service design and interaction, where web services participate in shared business events instead of one-to-one method invocations. These events are broadcasted to all participating web services simultaneously, and there is a distinction between transactional and non-transactional events. The concept of business events is highlighted as essential in the analysis and design phase, and the paper demonstrates how this approach can be implemented using SOAP messaging. This approach has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in web service interactions.
412280	41228040	Domain Modelling and the Co-Design of Business Rules in the Telecommunication Business Area	This paper discusses the creation of an enterprise domain model for a young telecommunications company. The company needed a way to integrate its stand-alone business support systems, so an enterprise-wide domain model was developed as an integration layer. However, due to the company's early stage, much of the domain knowledge was vague and not formalized. As a result, there was a need for co-designing business rules with the domain model. This process allowed the company to gain a better understanding of its business and develop a common understanding across functional areas. Overall, the development of the domain model helped the company improve its information infrastructure and business operations.
412280	41228056	A scenario-based verification technique to assess the compatibility of collaborative business processes	Successful e-business relies on smooth collaboration between partners and their respective rules and requirements. The verification of process compatibility, based on local and global views, is crucial for the success of this cooperation. As web services and service-oriented architectures become more prevalent, the pressure to achieve efficient and cost-effective collaborations increases. However, the complexity of message-based processes makes verification challenging. To address this, an atomic business activity based interaction model is proposed to simplify process models. Additionally, formal criteria for process compatibility, specifically semantic compatibility, are developed to accurately assess the compatibility between partners' publicly exposed behavior. This allows for a thorough analysis of both compatible and incompatible scenarios, including complex multi-party interactions. 
412281	41228150	Relaxed and Hybridized Backstepping.	This technical note discusses nonlinear control systems with structural obstacles that make it difficult to design traditional continuous backstepping feedback laws. Instead, a new approach is proposed where the origin of the closed-loop system is not globally asymptotically stable, but a suitable attractor is practically asymptotically stable. A hybrid feedback law is designed using a combination of backstepping and locally stabilizing controllers. The nonlinear dynamics are represented using a differential inclusion method, and the results are demonstrated on a system that cannot be stabilized globally using backstepping alone. 
412281	41228152	Combining a backstepping controller with a local stabilizer	The article discusses nonlinear control systems that have unique challenges in designing classical continuous stabilizing feedback laws. These systems cannot be solved using the traditional backstepping method and instead require a hybrid approach that combines a backstepping controller with a locally stabilizing controller. This results in a feedback law that makes the origin of the closed-loop system not globally asymptotically stable, but instead practically asymptotically stable at a suitable attractor. The proposed design method is demonstrated on a specific nonlinear system that does not have any globally stabilizing backstepping controller due to its structure.
412281	41228116	Cone-bounded feedback laws for m-dissipative operators on Hilbert spaces.	This study examines how certain restrictions affect the effectiveness of a stabilizing feedback law. The research focuses on an abstract nonlinear control system and assumes the existence of a linear feedback law that ensures global asymptotic stability of the system's origin. The feedback law is then modified using a cone-bounded nonlinearity. The study presents theorems that prove the well-posedness and stability of the modified feedback law, using the Schauder fixed-point theorem and an infinite-dimensional version of LaSalle’s invariance principle. Simulations on a linear Korteweg-de Vries equation and a nonlinear heat equation demonstrate the results.
412282	41228228	EnrichNet: network-based gene set enrichment analysis.	EnrichNet is a new approach and web-application that aims to improve the analysis of functional associations between gene/protein sets and databases. It addresses four limitations of the commonly used over-representation-based enrichment analysis: it can score non-overlapping gene/protein sets, considers genes with missing annotations, takes into account physical interactions between the gene/protein sets, and recognizes tissue-specific associations. EnrichNet combines a graph-based statistic and interactive sub-network visualization to prioritize putative functional associations and provide a biological interpretation of the results. When applied to sets of genes involved in human diseases, EnrichNet identified new pathway associations by highlighting a dense sub-network of interactions between their corresponding proteins.
412282	41228221	JEPETTO: a Cytoscape plugin for gene set enrichment and topological analysis based on interaction networks.	JEPETTO is a plugin for Cytoscape 3.x that performs integrative human gene set analysis. It uses protein interaction networks and topological analysis to identify functional associations between genes and known cellular pathways and processes. The plugin integrates information from three previously published web servers that specialize in enrichment analysis, pathways expansion, and topological matching. This integration makes it easier for users to analyze their gene sets and interpret the results. The usefulness of the JEPETTO plugin is demonstrated through its analysis of a set of misregulated genes related to Alzheimer's disease.
412282	41228273	TopoGSA: network topological gene set analysis.	 This allows for the identification and characterization of potential functional associations between gene sets and specific biological functionsTopoGSA is a web-application that helps analyze gene and protein sets in molecular interaction networks by calculating and displaying their topological properties. This includes measures like node centrality and clustering tendencies, which can be compared to known cellular pathways and processes to identify potential functional associations. By using TopoGSA, users can gain insights into the potential roles and functions of their gene sets, aiding in the understanding of biological processes.
412283	41228322	Piggyback CrowdSensing (PCS): energy efficient crowdsourcing of mobile sensor data by exploiting smartphone app opportunities	Mobile crowdsourcing is a rapidly evolving field thanks to the widespread use of sensor-enabled smartphones. This includes systems that provide information on highway congestion, but participation in these systems can drain battery resources. To address this issue, the authors propose Piggyback CrowdSensing (PCS), which collects sensor data during phone calls or app usage to minimize energy usage. They use a user-specific prediction model to determine the best times to collect data and found that PCS can collect large-scale sensor data while using significantly less energy compared to existing methods. 
412283	41228331	Unobtrusive sleep monitoring using smartphones	The way we sleep greatly affects our emotions and overall well-being. With the emergence of quantified-self apps and wearable devices, people now have the ability to track and measure their sleep duration, patterns, and quality. However, these methods can be intrusive and require users to modify their habits in order to gain accurate data. In this paper, a new approach called the best effort sleep (BES) model is introduced, which uses smartphones to infer sleep duration in a non-intrusive way. By analyzing various smartphone usage patterns and environmental observations, the BES model can accurately predict sleep duration without the user needing to interact with their phone. This approach was compared to other popular wearable devices and showed promising results in accurately measuring sleep duration.
412283	41228316	How to the Smash Next Billion Mobile App Bugs?	The rise of smartphones, tablets, and wearables has made the mobile app ecosystem crucial for developers and users. Creating and distributing apps has become easier, allowing even individual developers to reach global audiences. However, the diverse and dynamic operating conditions of mobile devices, such as device characteristics, network variations, and user behavior, make it difficult to test and ensure app performance. This has led to common issues like app failures and excessive energy consumption. To address this challenge, the authors have developed scalable automated mobile app testing techniques through two prototype services, VanarSena and Caiipa. They propose a unified cloud-based mobile app testing service, SMASH, that combines the strengths of these systems to tackle the complexity of testing mobile apps.
412284	41228418	BeWell+: multi-dimensional wellbeing monitoring with community-guided user feedback and energy optimization	This paper discusses the development of a new smartphone app, BeWell+, which monitors three aspects of health: sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. The app uses persuasive feedback through an ambient display on the phone's wallpaper to promote better behavioral patterns. The new version of the app includes two new mechanisms: community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which can be tailored to different user communities, and wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring and feedback on specific health dimensions. The app was tested in a 19-day field trial with 27 participants, and results showed that the app was successful in promoting healthier lifestyles through user understanding and response to feedback. 
412284	41228448	Preference, context and communities: a multi-faceted approach to predicting smartphone app usage patterns	In this paper, the authors propose a multi-faceted approach to predicting smartphone app usage. This approach takes into account three key factors that influence app usage: intrinsic user preferences, environmental factors, and shared aggregate patterns of app behavior. The authors conducted a 3-week field trial with 35 users and analyzed app usage logs from 4,606 smartphone users worldwide to evaluate their model. They found that their approach not only produces more accurate app predictions, but also has the potential to optimize smartphone system performance. This highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in predicting app usage behavior in order to benefit both users and the phone system.
412284	41228429	Passive and In-situ Assessment of Mental and Physical Well-being using Mobile Sensors.	Mobile-sensing systems for continuously monitoring well-being are becoming more popular. They have the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional surveys used by the medical community. However, current systems only focus on tracking physical health and have not been compared to medically accepted screening instruments for mental health. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a multi-modal mobile sensing system that can assess both mental and physical health. By collecting motion and audio data, the system can derive metrics that reflect the results of commonly used surveys. A case study also shows that continuous sensing can potentially avoid errors in assessment due to subjectivity in survey responses, by inferring social interactions and physical activities.
412285	41228557	Sliding Mode Model Semantics and Simulation for Hybrid Systems	This article discusses the characterization and simulation of dynamic physical systems operating in sliding regimes, which involve complex continuous behaviors at multiple temporal and spatial scales. To simplify behavior generation, models use time scale and parameter abstraction techniques, resulting in hybrid systems with both discrete and continuous behaviors. Mode transitions are caused by internal state changes and external control signals, and can sometimes exhibit chattering behaviors. This presents challenges for conventional simulation methods, so the article proposes an efficient and adaptive algorithm that considers the model semantics at the discontinuous boundaries. Simulation results show that this algorithm is more accurate and efficient for sliding mode systems compared to conventional integration methods.
412285	41228544	Monitoring and fault diagnosis of hybrid systems	The paper discusses the challenges of monitoring and diagnosing networked embedded sensing and control systems with hybrid dynamics. Existing model-based approaches focus on diagnostic reasoning, assuming appropriate fault signatures are available. However, integrating model-based techniques with sensor signal acquisition and processing, as well as fault modeling, is crucial for efficient fault detection and isolation. The paper presents a hybrid automata model that parameterizes abrupt and incipient faults, and an approach for diagnoser design using this model. It also introduces a mode estimation algorithm that uses model-based prediction to improve distributed processing of signals. A diagnostic system architecture that integrates modeling, prediction, and diagnosis is described and applied to fault diagnosis of an electro-mechanical machine. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and describe the design considerations for implementing the algorithms in online applications.
412285	41228515	Building observers to address fault isolation and control problems in hybrid dynamic systems	Model based approaches to diagnosis for dynamic systems have traditionally relied on either continuous or discrete event models. However, when dealing with hybrid systems that exhibit both continuous and discrete behaviors, this approach can be limiting. In order to overcome this issue, a new diagnostic methodology is proposed that utilizes hybrid models of the system. By incorporating both continuous and discrete behaviors, this methodology is able to more accurately diagnose faults and provide vital diagnostic information. This approach addresses the limitations of solely relying on either continuous or discrete models and offers a more comprehensive solution for diagnosing dynamic systems.
412286	41228629	A Design Model For Lifelong Learning Networks	The implementation of lifelong learning facilities has become a top priority for higher education institutions and distance learning programs, aiming to meet the needs of both industry and society. With the help of ICT networks, these facilities can be accessed seamlessly and ubiquitously at home, work, and in schools and universities. This requires a shift from traditional course and program-focused models to a learner-centered and learner-controlled approach. A conceptual model based on self-organization theory, learning communities, agent technologies, and learning technology specifications has been developed, and an exploratory implementation has been put into practice. Further reflection and development is needed to fully support lifelong learning.
412286	41228627	Testing the pedagogical expressiveness of IMS	The IMS Learning Design specification (LD) was created to improve upon existing learning technology specifications. Unlike other specifications, LD is an abstract model that can adapt content and integrate assessments based on different pedagogical approaches. To evaluate the pedagogical expressiveness of LD, 16 lesson plans were converted into LD using three different methods. Difficulties in expressing the lesson plans included sharing documents within a group, giving instructions before an activity, random group member assignments, creating an inventory for pre-knowledge mapping, and communicating lesson delivery information to teachers. However, no situations were found to be impossible to express with LD. The difficulties identified are discussed and suggestions are given for handling them. The three methods used are compared and recommendations are made for further research.
412286	41228656	Personal recommender systems for learners in lifelong learning networks: the requirements, techniques and model	The article argues that Personal Recommender Systems (PRSs) are necessary in Learning Networks (LNs) to guide learners in choosing appropriate learning activities. LNs cater to lifelong learners in various educational settings and rely on community contributions. Existing Recommender Systems (RS) and techniques used for consumer products are evaluated for their suitability in LNs. The article focuses on memory-based recommendation techniques, which use current data to make recommendations. A combination of these techniques is proposed for personalized recommendations in e-learning. The article also presents an initial model and a roadmap for the development of PRSs in LNs. 
412287	41228745	Probabilistic Sensor Fusion for Ambient Assisted Living.	There is a growing need to improve the current methods of providing healthcare, especially in the home setting. As part of the Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in Residential Environment (SPHERE) Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC), researchers are developing a multi-sensor platform with various network connections. However, this presents challenges in combining data from different sensors. To address this, Bayesian models for sensor fusion are introduced, which can identify the most useful modalities and relevant features for specific activities. The model also combines location prediction and activity recognition, resulting in a more efficient and accurate system. Testing on data from the SPHERE house shows its effectiveness and superiority over other benchmark models.
412287	41228740	Combining Bayesian Networks with Higher-Order Data Representations	Higher-Order Bayesian Networks (HBNs) are a type of probabilistic reasoning model that combines the efficiency of Bayesian Networks with the expressive capabilities of higher-order logics. This paper outlines how HBNs can be used to define probability distributions over higher-order terms and provides an example of their application in the Mutagenesis domain. By utilizing probabilistic inference and model learning, HBNs can be used to construct a probabilistic classifier. This approach has potential applications in fields such as Inductive Logic Programming. 
412287	41228721	Naive Bayesian Classification of Structured Data	The paper introduces 1BC and 1BC2, two systems that use naive Bayesian classification to classify structured individuals. 1BC uses first-order features, which are created using structural predicates that refer to related objects and properties. These features are treated as conditionally independent in the naive Bayes assumption. 1BC2 is an upgraded version that considers probability distributions over structured objects and estimates them based on independent probabilities of their elements. The two systems have been implemented in the first-order descriptive learner Tertius and have been tested on benchmark data sets. A new, efficient recursive algorithm has also been developed. The paper explores the differences between the two systems and presents experiments demonstrating their effectiveness.
412288	41228868	A Systematic Approach to Platform-Independent Design Based on the Service Concept	This paper discusses the importance and benefits of using the service concept in the model-driven design of distributed applications. A service is defined as the observable behavior of a system without imposing constraints on its internal structure. By utilizing services and designing application parts based on them, the design is not limited by interaction patterns provided by a specific middleware platform. This allows for platform-independence and potential reuse of application parts across various middleware platforms. The service concept is also used in defining an abstract platform, which considers the characteristics of potential target middleware platforms for platform-independent design. The paper also explores the trade-offs and alternatives for platform-specific realization in this approach.
412288	41228836	Interaction refinement in the design of business collaborations	Inter-organizational business collaborations are complex, and their design may require explicit modelling at multiple abstraction levels. This involves specifying the collaboration as a single abstract interaction at a high level, and breaking it down into more concrete interactions at a lower level. Interaction refinement is a design operation that replaces an abstract interaction with multiple related concrete interactions. Having a suitable interaction design concept for modelling at different abstraction levels can make this process easier. It is also important to have supporting design operations to ensure the correctness and conformity of the interaction refinement. This paper introduces an interaction design concept and associated operations to aid in the design of business collaborations at different abstraction levels.
412288	41228818	Model-Driven Design, Refinement And Transformation Of Abstract Interactions	The article discusses the use of model-driven design in creating applications, where the interaction between different parts can be described at different levels of platform-independence. At the lowest level, specific middleware platforms provide interaction mechanisms, while at higher levels, the interaction must be described in a way that can be adapted to different middleware platforms. The paper explores concepts and design operations that support this process of interaction design, and proposes a way to refine interactions while taking into account the implementation constraints of different platforms. This is achieved through the use of transformation and conformance, ensuring that the resulting target designs maintain the desired characteristics of the initial source designs.
412289	41228917	A reconstruction and extension of Maple's assume facility via constraint contextual rewriting	Maple's symbolic evaluator and assume facility allow for powerful conditional rewriting. Previous research showed that Maple's evaluation can be seen as constraint contextual rewriting (CCR), which integrates decision procedures through a specific interface. This study extends the analysis to the general solver, which handles problems beyond linear arithmetic. A flaw was discovered that causes Maple to give incorrect results in certain contexts, as it falsely assumes the general solver uses all available assumptions. While a quick fix would weaken the assume facility, a more comprehensive approach based on CCR techniques avoids this issue and results in stronger simplification abilities.
412289	41228927	New results on rewrite-based satisfiability procedures	Program analysis and verification require decision procedures to reason on theories of data structures. These problems can often be reduced to the satisfiability of sets of ground literals in a particular theory. If a reliable inference system for first-order logic is guaranteed to terminate on these satisfiability problems, any theorem-proving strategy using that system and a fair search plan can be considered a satisfiability procedure for that theory. In this study, the termination of a rewrite-based first-order engine on theories of records, integer offsets, integer offsets modulo, and lists is proven. A modularity theorem is also introduced, stating conditions for termination on combined theories, given termination on each individual theory. Various benchmarks are presented to test the performance of this approach, including synthetic benchmarks for scalability and real-world problems with large sets of literals. A comparison with other validity checkers shows that the rewrite-based theorem prover E performs well, challenging the belief that general-purpose provers are inferior to reasoners with built-in theories. This study demonstrates the elegance and practical implications of the rewriting approach for decision procedures in program analysis and verification.
412289	41228977	LTL Model Checking for Security Protocols	The paper discusses the limitations of current model checking techniques for security protocols, which often assume a Dolev-Yao intruder and do not consider secure communication channels. To address this, the authors propose a new model using set-rewriting and LTL, allowing for the specification of assumptions and complex security properties. This approach was used to analyze the ASW protocol for optimistic fair exchange, uncovering a new attack even on a patched version of the protocol.
412290	41229071	A Theory of Singly-Linked Lists and its Extensible Decision Procedure	The availability of a decision procedure for pointer-based data structures is essential for effective reasoning. However, current solutions only offer approximate solutions that lack precision in verification techniques. In this paper, a new theory called TLL is introduced for singly-linked lists, which can accurately express both data and reachability constraints. The decidability of TLL is ensured and a practical decision procedure is designed, making it compatible with existing decision procedures for first-order logic theories. This provides a more precise and efficient approach to reasoning about pointer-based data structures.
412290	41229015	Light-weight theorem proving for debugging and verifying units of code	Software bugs can be difficult to find, even in small sections of code. To help with this, techniques have been developed that generate a set of formulas to check for errors. However, these techniques rely on a theorem prover to automatically solve the proofs. Building such a tool can be challenging and prone to errors. In this paper, the authors propose combining superposition theorem provers and BDDs to create a highly automatic and flexible prover. Experimental results on C functions manipulating pointers show that this method can handle proof obligations that other tools cannot, and performs better in general.
412290	4122902	Efficient satisfiability modulo theories via delayed theory combination	Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is becoming increasingly important in verification due to its ability to model real-world problems beyond propositional logic. This paper focuses on the case where the background theory is a combination of two simpler theories. Most SMT procedures use a combination of boolean model enumeration and a decision procedure for the combined theory, but this paper proposes a new approach called Delayed Theory Combination. This approach only requires individual decision procedures for each theory, which are integrated into the boolean model enumerator. It is simpler and more efficient, and can handle non-convex theories. Experimental results show its effectiveness.
412291	412291104	A First Approach to Provide Anonymity in Attribute Certificates	This paper discusses the importance of authorization and anonymity in internet applications. Traditional authorization methods are not always effective, but attribute certificates proposed by ITU-T offer a suitable solution. As internet transactions are easily recorded, anonymity has become a desirable feature. The paper proposes a solution to enhance X.509 attribute certificates to include conditional anonymity. A protocol is also presented for obtaining these certificates while protecting user anonymity through a blind signature scheme. The use of these certificates is explored, along with potential problems and open issues. 
412291	412291143	A New Design of Privilege Management Infrastructure for Organizations Using Outsourced PKI	Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) have been used for authentication services in e-commerce applications, but they do not fully meet the needs of these applications. Additional authorization services are needed for users to prove their permissions. Attribute certificates have changed the approach to authorization, and Privilege Management Infrastructures (PMI) provide the necessary support for their use. While PKIs and PMIs are related, they can operate independently, making it appealing for companies to outsource PKI services. However, due to the confidential information contained in attribute certificates, outsourcing PMI services is not always a viable option. This paper presents a new design for PMIs that is suitable for companies outsourcing PKI services but still needing to manage PMIs internally. This scheme also addresses issues with revocation procedures and offers additional benefits for intra-company attribute certification. 
412291	412291101	Distributed Storage and Revocation in Digital Certificate Databases	Public-key cryptography is becoming increasingly important for secure communication in open networks. However, the widespread use of public-key certificates requires efficient and reliable management, especially when it comes to revocation. Many systems currently use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) to keep track of revoked certificates, but accessing these lists can be slow and introduce vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a distributed approach to certificate management, with each Certification Authority maintaining its own local database. Communication protocols between these databases are designed to minimize network traffic while maintaining security and efficiency. This alternative system eliminates the need for CRLs and provides a more efficient solution for managing digital certificates.
412292	41229212	Automatically Improving SAT Encoding of Constraint Problems Through Common Subexpression Elimination in Savile Row.	Efficient solving of Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) problems relies heavily on the formulation of the problem instance. Preprocessing and inprocessing techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of SAT solvers, but these methods operate on the low-level representation of the problem which makes it difficult and costly to identify higher-level patterns. Instead of directly reformulating the SAT representation, this approach uses automated reformulations on a higher level representation of the problem called a constraint model. This approach, known as Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE), has been shown to significantly improve the formulation of constraint satisfaction problems and can also have similar benefits when encoding the reformulated model to SAT and solving it with a state-of-the-art solver, resulting in speed improvements of over 100 times in some cases. 
412292	41229233	Propagation algorithms for lexicographic ordering constraints	Finite-domain constraint programming is a powerful tool for solving complex combinatorial problems in various fields. It involves modeling the problem using constraints on a set of decision variables. Symmetry in the decision variable matrices can lead to redundancy in searching for solutions. To address this, an algorithm called GACLexLeq has been developed to establish generalised arc consistency by constraining the rows and columns to be in lexicographical order. This algorithm has been shown to be efficient and can be decomposed into smaller constraints for better performance. Extensions and modifications have also been made to handle strict lexicographical ordering and unequal vector lengths. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GACLexLeq in various domains.
412292	41229213	Exploiting short supports for generalised arc consistency for arbitrary constraints	Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms, like the one used for the element constraint, often use short supports to save time and infer support for all variables and values. However, general purpose propagation algorithms, such as GAC-Schema, have not yet utilized this technique and still rely on supports involving all variables. In response to this, a new general purpose propagation algorithm called SHORTGAC has been developed. It can use either an explicit list of allowed short tuples or a function to calculate the next supporting short tuple. Empirical analyses have shown that SHORTGAC is more efficient than other general purpose algorithms, and in some cases, it performs similarly to special-purpose propagators.
412293	41229325	Collaborative work with linear classifier and extreme learning machine for fast text categorization	This paper discusses the importance of fast text categorization in the digital age and explores current methods that either sacrifice accuracy for speed or vice versa. The authors propose a new approach that combines a linear classifier and an extreme learning machine (ELM) to achieve both speed and accuracy. The linear classifier, obtained through a modified non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, quickly maps documents from the original term space into the class space. The ELM then uses nonlinear and linear transformations to further improve classification accuracy. Experimental results show that this approach is not only accurate but also significantly faster, with a 180% increase in speed compared to previous methods.
412293	41229352	Dimensionality reduction with category information fusion and non-negative matrix factorization for text categorization	Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to improve the efficiency of classifiers in text categorization. Non-negative matrix factorization is a commonly used method to map high dimensional term spaces into low dimensional semantic subspaces. However, this method is sensitive to noise, data missing, and outliers, leading to unsatisfactory classification performance. To address this issue, a new approach has been proposed that combines the training text and category information to obtain a transformation matrix using basis orthogonality non-negative matrix factorization and truncation. This allows for aggressive dimensionality reduction while maintaining good classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving a low dimensional semantic subspace while maintaining accurate classification.
412293	41229346	A Manifold Alignment Approach for Hyperspectral Image Visualization With Natural Color.	The visualization of hyperspectral images (HSIs) using trichromatic color has been a popular area of research. However, most existing methods use false color which can be confusing for users. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for visualizing HSIs with natural color by combining them with a high-resolution color image using manifold alignment. This aligns the two data sets in a shared embedding space, allowing for the transfer of natural color and spatial information. The method is flexible and can be used with various data sets, and can quickly generate natural color images for different HSIs acquired by the same sensor. Additionally, it allows for the visualization of user-specified bands, making it easier for users to analyze specific areas of interest. 
412294	41229462	Post-processing scheme for improving recognition performance of touching handwritten numeral strings	This paper outlines a method for improving recognition accuracy of handwritten numeral strings that are touching. The approach involves using verification factors, such as structural features and recognition probability, to identify and correct mis-segmented digits. A reconsideration condition is introduced, along with an additional segment digit set, to further refine the recognition results. Through experiments on a database of touching handwritten numeral strings, the proposed method showed promising results in terms of both accuracy and reliability.
412294	412294211	The recognition of handwritten numeral strings using a two-stage HMM-based method	This paper proposes a two-stage HMM-based recognition method that addresses the trade-off between segmentation and recognition in an implicit segmentation-based strategy. The first stage involves an implicit segmentation process that uses contextual information to generate multiple segmentation-recognition hypotheses. These are then verified and re-ranked in the second stage using an isolated digit classifier. The method allows for the use of two sets of features and numeral models, one focusing on both segmentation and recognition and the other only on recognition. Experimental results on 12,802 handwritten numeral strings showed that the two-stage method improved recognition rates by 9.9% on average and achieved a recognition rate of 89.6% on touching digit pairs. Overall, the two-stage approach shows promise in compensating for the trade-off between segmentation and recognition in handwritten numeral recognition.
412294	412294182	A New Approach for Segmentation and Recognition of Arabic Handwritten Touching Numeral Pairs	This paper presents a new method for segmenting and recognizing off-line Arabic handwritten numerals that cannot be separated using traditional connected component analysis. The proposed approach automatically segments touching numerals by selecting a set of parameters. Models with different parameter sets are created for each numeral pair and used for recognition. The images are first normalized and binarized, then gradient features are extracted and recognized using SVMs. A post-processing step is also introduced, which combines the recognition probabilities from different models to improve accuracy. Experiments were conducted on three different databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
412295	41229530	Timed default concurrent constraint programming	Synchronous programming is a powerful approach for programming reactive systems. It is based on the idea that processes are relations extended over time, and it provides a simple but effective model for timed, determinate computation. This model, called tcc, is extended to include strong time-outs, which are supported in synchronous programming languages. These operations are non-monotonic, but a compositional semantics is provided using Reiter's default logic. This framework, called Default cc, has a basic set of combinators and supports multiform time, orthogonal pre-emption, and executable specifications. It can also be read as logical formulae and compiled into finite state automata, allowing for separate compilation and run-time tradeoffs.
412295	41229552	Timed constraint programming: a declarative approach to usage control	This paper discusses different policy languages for access control, specifically in the form of trust-management systems and usage control. The authors propose a policy algebra in the timed concurrent constraint programming paradigm that addresses issues such as explicit denial, inheritance, and overriding, as well as history-sensitive access control. This policy algebra is declarative and supports equational reasoning through coinductive proofs based on an operational semantics. The authors also demonstrate the ability to perform security analysis with dynamic state-dependent restrictions using a combination of constraint reasoning and model checking techniques based on linear time temporal-logic. Overall, their framework allows for efficient and comprehensive reasoning about policies in access control.
412295	4122954	Default timed concurrent constraint programming	The model of [SJG94b] is expanded to include strong time-outs and pre-emption, where if an event does not occur by a certain time, another event is triggered. These constructs are commonly used in modeling transistors and are supported in languages like ESTEREL and LUSTRE. The challenge with these operators is that they are non-monotonic. A new semantics for concurrent constraint programming (CCP) is developed using Reiter's default logic, called Default Timed CCP (Default tcc). This allows for a smooth embedding of CCP processes into Default tcc processes, preserving important properties like determinacy and full-abstraction. Default tcc can represent various pre-emption constructs and is compatible with other synchronous programming languages. 
412296	412296123	Maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor for  -norm in two- and three-dimensional spaces	The Bichromatic Reverse Nearest Neighbor (BRNN) problem has been widely studied in spatial database research. This paper introduces a related problem called MaxBRNN, which involves finding the optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs for the L p-norm in two- and three-dimensional spaces. This problem has practical applications, such as finding the best location for a new server to attract the most customers based on proximity.

412296	412296120	Dynamic skyline queries in large graphs	This paper discusses dynamic skyline queries in a large graph, which report data points that are not dominated by other data points according to the distances between them and query points. While previous studies have focused on dynamic skylines in Euclidean space, road networks, and metric space, there has been no research on dynamic skylines over large graphs. The authors propose a filter-and-refine framework for efficient query processing and a pruning rule based on graph properties to derive candidates for the query. They also use a carefully-designed index structure to compute short path distances between vertices in O(H) time. Experimental results show that their methods outperform existing algorithms significantly.
412296	41229660	Efficient method for maximizing bichromatic reverse nearest neighbor	BRNN is a well-studied problem in spatial databases. This paper introduces a related problem, MaxBRNN, which aims to find the optimal region that can attract the maximum number of customers by proximity. This problem has practical applications, such as finding a new server location. The traditional method of determining BRNNs for all possible points is not feasible due to the large number of points. The current fastest method has exponential time complexity. To address this, the authors propose an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap, which exploits certain properties of the problem. Experiments show that MaxOverlap is significantly faster than existing techniques.
412297	41229728	Mosaicing-by-recognition for video-based text recognition	Recognizing text from a hand-held video camera can be difficult because the camera may capture multiple frames with overlapping text. To improve the quality of the text image, the frames must be registered and mosaiced, accounting for camera shakes. This paper proposes a mosaicing-by-recognition technique that combines video mosaicing and text recognition into a single optimization problem. Using a dynamic programming-based optimization algorithm, this technique can accurately estimate distortions and achieve high character recognition accuracy, even with various camera movements. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can achieve around 90% perfect distortion estimation and over 95% character recognition accuracy.

A universal method that works well for all types is difficult to develop. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for classifying graphics-scene and 2D-3D texts in video to improve accuracy. The method includes an iterative process to identify text candidates, using stroke width and medial axis values to classify graphics and scene texts, and combining proximity and gradient directions for 2D and 3D texts. Each step of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to existing methods, showing the effectiveness and necessity of video text classification in enhancing text detection and recognition systems. 
412297	4122970	Scene Character Detection And Recognition With Cooperative Multiple-Hypothesis Framework	The proposed framework aims to handle the diversity of characters in scene images by using a cooperative multiple-hypothesis approach. This consists of an image operator set module, an OCR module, and an integration module. The image operator set module probes suspected character regions using multiple parameters, while the OCR module returns multiple candidates with weight values for integration. The integration module automatically removes redundant results and fills in missing ones without relying on heuristic rules. This framework effectively combines character detection and recognition, allowing for special scenarios such as single characters or text along curves. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that this approach outperforms single-hypothesis methods and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of various metrics. Two additional experiments also demonstrate the simplicity of parameter setting in this framework.

The study of physiological signals has become increasingly popular in understanding everyday activities such as watching videos or looking at pictures. Tracking these signals can provide insight into the user's mental state and emotions. Researchers are now exploring the relationship between a reader's physiological signals and their feelings while reading, as well as how it relates to the content of the reading material.

They found that by using a support vector machine, they were able to accurately predict which genre of manga the reader was reading with 90% accuracy. This research sheds light on the potential for using physiological signals in understanding reading experiences.
412299	41229991	Document Image Retrieval for QA Systems Based on the Density Distributions of Successive Terms	Question answering (QA) involves retrieving an answer to a question by analyzing documents.

412301	41230111	Qualitative Bayesian Networks with Logical Constraints	Qualitative Bayesian Networks (QBNs) are useful for describing conditional independence models, but they cannot handle models with logical constraints. This paper presents an extension of QBNs that can represent both conditional independence and logical constraints. The algorithm for building these graphs is a generalization of the traditional D-separation criterion. This theory is well-suited for conditional probabilistic independence models that use the concept of cs-independence, which avoids issues that arise with the classic definition when logical constraints are present. Overall, this extended version of QBNs allows for a more comprehensive representation of complex models.
412302	412302108	EMD-L1: an efficient and robust algorithm for comparing histogram-based descriptors	EMD-L1 is a fast algorithm for calculating the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between two histograms. It simplifies the original formulation by reducing the number of unknown variables to O(N) and the number of constraints by half. The algorithm is formally equivalent to the original EMD with L1 ground distance and uses an efficient tree-based approach to compute the distance. It has a time complexity of O(N2), making it much faster than previous algorithms. EMD-L1 allows for comparing histogram-based features, which was previously not feasible. Experiments on shape recognition and interest point matching show that EMD-L1 outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in these tasks.
412302	412302101	Diffusion Distance for Histogram Comparison	In this paper, the authors introduce a new measure called diffusion distance for comparing histogram-based descriptors. This measure uses a temperature field to represent the difference between two histograms and takes into account deformation and quantization effects through a diffusion process. The diffusion distance is computed as the sum of dissimilarities over various scales and is robust to changes in shape, lighting, and noise. It also has a linear computational complexity, making it more efficient than other cross-bin distances with higher complexities.

The inner-distance is defined as the shortest path between landmark points within the shape silhouette and is shown to be more effective than the traditional Euclidean distance. This approach can be used for complex shapes with articulated parts and can also be combined with texture information for improved shape classification. Three methods using the inner-distance are proposed and tested on various shape databases, demonstrating effective performance compared to other algorithms.

The features are extracted in a similar way to interpreting pulsation signals in diagnosis. The experimental results show that this method improves emotion recognition when used with a neural network classifier. This suggests that incorporating oriental medicine principles into emotion recognition systems can be effective.
412304	41230429	A Logical Framework For Set Theories	Axiomatic set theory is widely accepted as the foundation of mathematics and is useful for managing mathematical knowledge. However, there are gaps between the official set theory formulations and actual mathematical practice. This work presents a new framework for formalizing different strengths of axiomatic set theories, from basic to full ZF. It allows the use of set terms, but ensures their validity through a static check. The framework is based on two set-theoretical principles: extensionality and comprehension, with the option to include induction and the axiom of choice. Comprehension is formulated as a relation between elements and formulas. Different systems vary in their use of safety relations, which are defined syntactically and based on the safety relation used in commercial query languages for databases.

It can also be used to develop scientifically applicable mathematics using weak set theories that are predicatively acceptable. These theories have the property that all objects used in them are defined by a closed term, allowing for a concrete, computationally-oriented interpretation. However, the framework is not limited to this interpretation and can be expanded to handle stronger set theories, such as ZFC.

Top-k queries, which rank the data based on a certain criteria, are useful in analyzing uncertain data in these applications. This paper focuses on the problem of answering probabilistic threshold top-k queries, which calculates the probability of at least p for an uncertain record to be in the top-k list. The paper presents three algorithms - an exact one, a fast sampling one, and a Poisson approximation based one - for efficiently answering these queries. An empirical study using real and synthetic data shows the effectiveness of probabilistic threshold top-k queries and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
412305	412305218	Probabilistic path queries in road networks: traffic uncertainty aware path selection	Path queries, which involve finding the shortest path in terms of travel time between two points in a road network, are widely used in various applications. Currently, simple statistic aggregates are commonly used to answer such queries, but they often fail to capture the uncertainty in traffic. In this paper, the authors propose three types of probabilistic path queries that take traffic uncertainty into account, using basic probability principles. These queries involve finding paths that meet certain criteria, such as a maximum travel time with a high probability. To efficiently evaluate these queries, the authors develop several probability calculation methods and a best-first search algorithm. An empirical study with real and synthetic data shows the effectiveness of the proposed queries and the efficiency of the evaluation methods.

They present an efficient algorithm that utilizes novel pruning techniques to solve this type of query on multidimensional uncertain data. The experimental results show that their algorithm outperforms a sampling-based approximate algorithm and is highly scalable.
412306	41230628	Unfolding Based Minimal Test Suites for Testing Multithreaded Programs	This paper discusses the challenge of finding the smallest set of tests that cover all executable statements in a multithreaded program. Previous research has used unfoldings to accurately represent the concurrency in such programs and generate test cases. Building on this, the paper presents a method for using unfoldings to generate the minimal test suite that covers all executable statements. However, this problem is shown to be NP-complete in the size of the unfolding. The paper also proposes using SMT-encodings to solve this problem and provides preliminary results for several benchmarks. Additionally, the paper shows that finding the minimal test suite for any terminating safe Petri net is also NP-complete in the size of its unfolding. 
412306	41230630	Linear Encodings of Bounded LTL Model Checking	This content discusses the problem of bounded model checking for linear temporal logic (LTL) and presents efficient encodings that have a linear size. The encodings can also be extended to LTL with past operators (PLTL) but cannot detect minimal length counterexamples. To overcome this limitation, the virtual unrolling technique is introduced, but it results in a quadratic size encoding. The virtual unrolling is also extended to Buchi automata, allowing for the detection of minimal length counterexamples. These encodings can also be made incremental to benefit from incremental SAT technology. Experiments show that these dedicated encodings improve the performance of BMC and are competitive in finding bugs. However, for proving complex properties, BDD-based methods still tend to be more efficient. 
412306	41230644	Unfolding based automated testing of multithreaded programs	Dynamic symbolic execution is a method used to systematically explore the nondeterminism caused by input data in multithreaded programs. In this study, the authors propose a new approach that combines dynamic symbolic execution with unfoldings, a method used in Petri nets and other models of concurrency. Through experimental comparison, they show that this new approach can significantly reduce the number of test runs needed to explore the reachable control states of each thread. This reduction can even be exponential, making it more efficient for testing programs with long executions or complex constraints. The algorithm also generates a structure that can detect deadlocks efficiently.
412307	41230714	Oblivious Network RAM and Leveraging Parallelism to Achieve Obliviousness.	ORAM, or Oblivious RAM, is a cryptographic tool that allows a trusted CPU to access untrusted memory without revealing any information about the data being accessed. It has many potential uses in secure processor design and secure multi-party computation for managing large amounts of data. However, due to a lower bound on its efficiency, ORAM incurs a moderate cost in practical applications. To address this issue, the Oblivious Network RAM model of computation is proposed, where a CPU communicates with multiple memory banks in a way that hides the specific address being accessed. This reduces the overall cost of obliviousness and has potential applications in secure processor design and distributed storage with a network adversary. New constructions for simulating programs in this model are also presented.
412307	41230715	SCORAM: Oblivious RAM for Secure Computation	ORAMs are often measured by their bandwidth overhead and client storage, but when used in secure computation protocols for RAM programs, the size of the ORAM circuits becomes more important. This study focuses on the circuit-complexity of various ORAM constructions and finds that asymptotic analysis does not accurately reflect their performance in practical scenarios. A new design called SCORAM is introduced, which is optimized for secure computation protocols and is almost 10x smaller in circuit size and faster than other designs tested for realistic settings. This makes it possible to perform secure computations on large data sets, up to gigabyte sizes.
412307	41230767	Circuit ORAM: On Tightness of the Goldreich-Ostrovsky Lower Bound.	Circuit ORAM is a new tree-based scheme that offers both theoretical and practical contributions. It proves that the well-known Goldreich-Ostrovsky logarithmic ORAM lower bound is accurate for certain parameters, which has been a long-standing challenge. It also achieves nearly optimal circuit size in both theory and practice, making it well-suited for secure multi-party computation. This makes Circuit ORAM a promising solution for improving the performance of secure data access and storage.
412308	41230857	Reducing power density through activity migration	Modern microprocessors have uneven distribution of power dissipation, resulting in localized hot spots with higher temperatures than surrounding areas. This can lead to decreased reliability and even failure. To address this issue, activity migration is proposed, which involves moving computation between multiple replicated units to reduce peak junction temperature. By incorporating a thermal model that considers the temperature-dependent leakage power, it is shown that this technique can increase sustainable power dissipation by almost two times while maintaining the same junction temperature limit. Alternatively, peak die temperature can be reduced by 12.4°C at the same clock frequency. The model suggests that migration intervals of 20-200 μs are necessary for maximum sustainable power increase. Different forms of replication and migration policy control are evaluated. 
412308	41230854	Replacing global wires with an on-chip network: a power analysis	This paper explores the potential benefits of replacing global chip wires with an on-chip network in terms of power consumption. By optimizing network links through repeater spacing, link pipelining, and voltage scaling, the energy required to send data across the chip can be significantly reduced. The paper presents an analytical model for large chip designs using a two-dimensional mesh network, and examines potential power savings for two different design scenarios: a circuit-switched ASIC or FPGA design, and a dynamic packet-switched tiled architecture. Results show that for circuit-switched networks, power savings of 35-50% can be achieved with 1 mm links, while the use of multiplexing and signal encoding in packet-switched designs can result in around 20% savings with optimal tile sizes of 2 mm. 
412308	41230821	Dynamic fine-grain leakage reduction using leakage-biased bitlines	Leakage power, which is a significant contributor to overall power consumption, can be reduced by dynamically deactivating fast transistors. To effectively compare fine-grain dynamic deactivation techniques, metrics that consider deactivation energy and startup latencies as well as long-term leakage current have been introduced. A new circuit-level technique, called leakage-biased bitlines, has been proposed for reducing leakage current with low deactivation energy and fast wake-up times. This technique can be applied within an active microprocessor and can be improved with microarchitectural scheduling policies. For example, using leakage-biased bitlines to deactivate SRAM read paths in I-cache memories can save 24% of leakage energy and 22% of total I-cache energy in a 70 nm process. Similarly, fine-grained read port deactivation in the register file can save nearly 50% of leakage energy and 22% of total energy, while turning off idle subbanks in the register file can save 67% of leakage energy and 57% of total register file energy without affecting performance.
412309	41230938	Optimal maintenance of a spanning tree	This article discusses the importance of keeping track of history in dynamic network protocols and presents a communication optimal maintenance algorithm for a spanning tree in a dynamic network. This algorithm has an amortized message complexity of O(V), where V is the number of nodes, and a message size of O(log &verbar;ID&verbar;). This efficient maintenance of a spanning tree can improve various distributed algorithms such as broadcast, multicast, routing, and termination detection. The authors also introduce a novel technique to save communication by using past information to deduce present information. This technique is one of the main contributions of the study.
412309	41230977	Adapting to asynchronous dynamic networks (extended abstract)	The computational power of different communication models is an important topic in distributed computation theory. In some models, messages are assumed to be delivered quickly, while in others, delays can be unpredictable. The topology of the network is also a crucial factor, with some models allowing for dynamic changes in the network structure. In this paper, the authors demonstrate that the model of an asynchronous, dynamic-topology network is equivalent to a synchronous, static model with the trade-off of only a small increase in time, messages, and space required. This method has been successfully applied to various applications such as Breadth First Search, routing tables, and packet routing.
412309	41230946	Local management of a global resource in a communication network	The paper discusses a new distributed data object called Resource Controller that manages the consumption of global resources in a distributed system. Examples of resources that can be managed include messages sent, nodes participating, and CPU time consumed. The object is accessed through a procedure and imposes constraints on resource consumption. It guarantees that the total number of permits granted is at most M and ensures that if a request is rejected, at least M-W permits will eventually be granted. The paper also presents efficient implementations of the Resource Controller, including one with a message complexity of O(n log2n log(M/(W+1))). This is in contrast to a fully centralized controller with a message complexity of O(nM).
412310	41231038	Transliteration by bidirectional statistical machine translation	The paper discusses a system that uses statistical machine translation to transliterate between all language pairs in a shared task. This technique does not rely on language-specific assumptions or dictionaries, and instead directly translates sequences of tokens from the source language to the target language. The system is comprised of two phrase-based SMT decoders, one generating the target from the first token to the last, and the other from the last to the first. Results show that a combination of these two approaches is most effective, with the optimal choice depending on the specific languages involved.
412310	41231025	Rescoring a phrase-based machine transliteration system with recurrent neural network language models	This year's shared transliteration evaluation includes a system that uses a phrase-based statistical machine transliteration framework. It incorporates a joint source-channel model, a target language model, and models for controlling sequence length. The joint source-channel model was trained using a Bayesian bilingual alignment. The main focus of the system is on input representation, and to address data sparseness issues, it has been augmented with recurrent neural network models. Experiments on development data showed that using an RNN language model can improve performance for language pairs with large grapheme sets on the target side.
412310	41231060	Dynamic model interpolation for statistical machine translation	This paper introduces a class-dependent decoding technique for statistical machine translation (SMT). Unlike previous methods, this approach integrates class-dependent models directly into the decoding process using probabilistic mixture weights. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through evaluation on travel conversation data, specifically for translating questions and declarative sentences. The system incorporates two sets of models for these two classes of sentences, as well as a general set for all other types of sentences. The technique was evaluated on 17 language pairs using 6 different metrics, and was found to improve translation performance in most cases, with substantial improvements seen for some languages. 
412311	41231135	Using ensemble method to improve the performance of genetic algorithm	Ensemble methods, which involve combining multiple learning algorithms to improve performance, have been extensively researched and applied in machine learning. The basic concept is to use a "weak" algorithm that performs slightly better than random guessing, and "boost" it into a highly accurate "strong" algorithm. Building upon this idea, a paper proposes a new hybrid optimization algorithm called GA ensemble, which uses ensemble methods to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms. This involves running multiple genetic algorithms on the same problem and using bagging to sample from a pool of solutions. Experimental results on various optimization problems demonstrate that the ensemble approach greatly improves the performance of genetic algorithms.

This system is considered to be challenging due to its redundancy and lack of a general solution. The EDA algorithm utilizes a Gaussian probability model to generate optimal joint motions for the system. Compared to simple genetic algorithms (SGA), this approach requires fewer parameters and significantly reduces the time for motion optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly effective in generating and optimizing motion for the flexible macro-micro manipulator system.

This involves designing a collection of evolutionary algorithms that work together to solve the same problem. Two methods for implementing this approach are described: data-based ensemble and model-based ensemble. In data-based ensemble, algorithms share a common data pool and use a bagging method to sample from it. In model-based ensemble, a collection of models cooperate through information interaction. The paper provides examples of using these methods with simple genetic algorithm and PBIL. Experiments on combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that ensemble method can improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms, making a 'weak' algorithm stronger.
412312	41231213	The Mystery of Structure and Function of Sensory Processing Areas of the Neocortex: A Resolution.	This paper discusses various neural models that have been proposed to explain memory in primates. While there is no direct evidence to support one model over others, the authors suggest that models can be evaluated based on their complexity and predictive power. The authors propose a computational framework that assumes neural information processing is done by generative networks. This framework suggests a possible relationship between functional memory units and information encoding in primates, as well as the entorhinal-hippocampal loop. The authors also explore the idea that different layers of the cortex may have different functions. Finally, the concept of the homunculus fallacy is discussed in relation to this computational framework. Keywords include auto-associator, information processing, entorhinal-hippocampal loop, and information maximization.
412312	41231251	Controlled hierarchical filtering: Model of neocortical sensory processing	The article presents a model for processing sensory information that emphasizes the importance of learning internal generative models. These models can predict future events and evaluate the accuracy of those predictions. The model also connects to goal-oriented systems and is based on the structural similarities between a robust controller and the hippocampal entorhinal loop. The generative control architecture is mapped to the neocortex and hippocampal entorhinal loop, with implicit memory phenomena and priming being key aspects of the model. Mathematical theorems ensure the stability and effectiveness of the architecture, and connections to reinforcement learning are also established. The model also makes predictions about the role of feedback connections between neocortical areas.
412312	41231239	Autoregressive model of the hippocampal representation of events	The hippocampal formation is important in creating long-lasting memories of events, even though events are bounded in space and time. The authors propose a signal encoding model that can detect and predict events by representing causal relationships. This model is translated into a connectionist structure that follows biologically plausible rules. When applied to spatial inputs, the model shows similarities to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in terms of spatially localized and periodic neural activity. This sets it apart from other computational models of memory and suggests that it may describe the core function of the hippocampal region in forming memories and aiding in spatial navigation.
412313	41231345	Communication Efficient Coresets for Empirical Loss Minimization.	This paper addresses the issue of minimizing empirical loss with l2-regularization in distributed settings where communication cost is significant. Traditional methods like SGD are commonly used, but their high communication cost can lead to decreased performance. To address this, the paper proposes a new approach that uses a small summary of the data, called coreset, to reduce communication cost while maintaining good convergence. The paper presents a general framework for analyzing coreset-based optimization and offers insights into existing algorithms. A new coreset construction is also introduced, along with its convergence analysis for problems like logistic regression and support vector machines. Preliminary experiments on real-world datasets show promising results for this algorithm.
412313	41231311	Budgeted Distribution Learning of Belief Net Parameters	This article discusses the challenge of learning Bayesian belief networks, which are models of probabilistic distributions, when data is not initially available. The focus is on the problem of learning the parameters for a fixed structure that best match the true distribution, while taking into account a limited budget for acquiring data. The article explores various algorithms for this task, including non-sequential and sequential approaches. It is shown that the greedy allocation algorithm is optimal in some cases, but not always. The effectiveness of other heuristic algorithms is also explored.
412313	4123138	ProBO: a Framework for Using Probabilistic Programming in Bayesian Optimization.	Optimizing an expensive-to-query function is a common task in science and engineering, where minimizing the number of queries is important. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular strategy that uses probabilistic models, such as Gaussian processes (GPs), to achieve this. However, there are many other Bayesian modeling techniques that could be useful. Probabilistic programs (PPs) offer a flexible and powerful way to create models, but it can be challenging to incorporate them into BO. In this paper, the authors introduce ProBO, a framework that allows users to easily integrate any PP implementation into BO. They also propose a new model, called the Bayesian Product of Experts, which combines information from multiple PP models. Experimental results show that ProBO outperforms standard BO methods when using different PP implementations. 
412314	412314111	From Color Sensor Space to Feasible Reflectance Spectra	The interaction between light and object surfaces produces color signals that are responsible for the outputs of digital acquisition systems. In order to reverse this process and retrieve wavelength information, a lot of research has been done since 1964. The main approach is to use linear models to establish a one-to-one relationship between sensor data and reflectance spectra, while ensuring the quality and naturalness of the recovered spectrum. In this paper, the authors propose a solution to improve the quality of the recovered spectrum by considering smoothness and physical feasibility, which is achieved through the use of linear models. This strategy can be applied to any generic recovery method. 
412314	41231462	Multidomain Pixel Analysis For Illuminant Estimation And Compensation	This paper presents an algorithm for illuminant estimation and compensation in digital still cameras, which is not dependent on the device used. It takes into account both chromaticity and intensity information and uses a diagonal transform for compensation. The algorithm combines a spatial segmentation process with weighting functions to select objects with the most information for accurate chromaticity estimation. It was evaluated on a database of real scene images with controlled illuminant conditions and showed improved performance compared to single domain pixel analysis. The algorithm was designed using an experimental framework developed by the authors.
412314	41231439	Aesthetics Assessment Of Images Containing Faces	Recent research has focused on assessing the aesthetic quality of images with generic content, but there is a lack of approaches specifically designed for images with human faces. This paper presents a method for predicting the aesthetic quality of images with faces. It utilizes three Convolutional Neural Networks to capture information about perceptual quality, global image aesthetics, and facial attributes. These features are then combined in a model to accurately predict the aesthetics of images containing faces. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach surpasses existing methods in predicting both binary (low/high) and continuous aesthetic scores on four different databases. 
412315	41231542	CAESAR_SOLVE: A generic library for on-the-fly resolution of alternation-free Boolean equation systems	Boolean equation systems (Bess) are a useful tool for modeling verification problems on finite-state concurrent systems. These problems, such as equivalence checking and model checking, can be solved on the fly without explicitly constructing the state space of the system. A demand-driven approach is used for construction and resolution of the Bess. A generic software library has been developed for on-the-fly resolution of alternation-free Bess. It currently offers four resolution algorithms, including specialized ones for handling specific types of Bess in a memory-efficient way. The library is developed within the Cadp verification toolbox and is used for on-the-fly equivalence checking, model checking, and state space reduction.
412315	41231529	Improved On-the-Fly Equivalence Checking Using Boolean Equation Systems	Equivalence checking is a verification method used to ensure that a concurrent system (protocol) behaves as intended (service) by comparing their underlying labeled transition systems (Ltss) using an equivalence relation. The on-the-fly approach for equivalence checking incrementally explores the synchronous product of Ltss to avoid state explosion and efficiently detect errors in complex systems. However, when the Ltss are equivalent, the global approach outperforms the on-the-fly approach by building the Ltss and calculating equivalence classes with partition refinement. This paper proposes two enhancements to the on-the-fly approach for equivalent Ltss: a faster encoding of equivalence relations and a more efficient local boolean equation system (Bes) resolution algorithm. These enhancements were incorporated into the Bisimulator2.0 equivalence checker and showed significant performance improvements compared to existing on-the-fly algorithms.
412315	41231525	Distributed On-the-Fly Equivalence Checking	On-the-fly equivalence checking is a method of comparing two Labeled Transition Systems (Ltss) using a given equivalence relation in a demand-driven approach. This allows for error detection in large systems that cannot be stored in a computer's memory. The paper proposes DSolve, a new algorithm for distributed on-the-fly resolution of Boolean Equation Systems (Bess), which can check equivalence for various relations characterized in terms of Bess. DSolve is used in the distributed version of Bisimulator, an on-the-fly equivalence checker, which showed good scalability and speedups in experiments. This approach aims to improve the performance of on-the-fly equivalence checking by using multiple machines connected by a network.

Digital forensics is a crucial aspect of investigations, where minimizing the number of person-hours spent while ensuring the authenticity of evidence is important. However, the literature shows that there are several challenges that lead to an increase in person-hours. This paper examines these challenges and argues that they do not fully explain the increase in investigation time. The study uses real case records from the Dubai Police and identifies other factors that contribute to the increase in person-hours. The paper concludes by highlighting the various factors that affect person-hours, contrary to what is commonly proposed in the literature.
412316	41231618	Constructing The Cool Wall: A Tool To Explore Teen Meanings Of Cool	This paper introduces a tool called the Cool Wall, which was created to help designers understand what is considered "cool" by teenagers when designing interactive products. The tool is based on theoretical concepts of coolness and consists of seven core categories that are mapped to a hierarchy. The paper discusses the development and construction of the Cool Wall, as well as the results and analysis of three studies. The first study was conducted in a school in the UK and provided clear insights into cool things for teenagers. The second and third studies revealed potential shortcomings in the methodology but also provided valuable insights into the meaning of the images used in the Cool Wall. Overall, the Cool Wall is a useful tool for understanding coolness in the design of interactive products for teenagers.
412316	41231656	On being cool: exploring interaction design for teenagers	The paper discusses a series of studies that focused on the concept of "cool" in the design of interactive products for teenagers. The studies were based on a model that defined cool in terms of having, doing, and being cool. The findings of the studies were consistent with the model, and the different methods used provided valuable insights. The paper also presents a set of key aspects for designing cool products and provides an example. Overall, the studies confirm the complexity of designing for cool and offer suggestions for avoiding uncool designs.
412317	41231762	The Phenomenology of Remembered Experience: A Repertoire for Design.	The study aims to understand how people experience autobiographical remembering and how design-driven research can benefit from this understanding. Through interviews using the repertory grid technique, the study identifies five categories of personal constructs that characterize people's remembered experiences: contentment, confidence/unease, social interactions, reflection, and intensity. These categories align with previous classifications of personal constructs and models of human emotion. The study suggests that this categorization can be used to evaluate interactive technologies for supporting remembering and highlights the potential for future improvements.
412317	41231761	Expected information needs of parents for pervasive awareness systems	This paper discusses the use of awareness systems to meet the communication needs of busy parents. The authors conducted an online survey with 69 participants to explore the types of information that are most valued by parents. The results showed that personalized and intentional information is preferred over low granularity and automatically collected information. Additionally, the study found that people's attitudes towards sharing information about themselves align with what they want to know about their partners. Furthermore, the direction and symmetry of information flow do not significantly impact people's preferences for information. These findings suggest that awareness systems can effectively support busy parents' communication needs.
412317	41231757	Two acts of social intelligence: the effects of mimicry and social praise on the evaluation of an artificial agent	The study discussed in this paper examines the impact of mimicry and social praise, two forms of social intelligence, when utilized by an artificial social agent. Through an experiment involving 50 participants, it was found that social praise, in the form of positive feedback, increases the perceived friendliness of a chat-robot. Additionally, mimicry, which involves mirroring behavior, enhances the perceived intelligence of the robot. The authors recommend that designers consider incorporating both mimicry and social praise in their systems if they are meant to function as social actors. Different methods for implementing these techniques in an ambient persuasive setting are also explored.
412318	41231832	The International Children's Digital Library: Description and analysis of first use	The International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) is a five-year research project aimed at providing children with access to a diverse collection of children's books from around the world. The paper discusses the importance of this research and outlines the development of new interface technologies to make the ICDL accessible to children. It also compares the ICDL to other digital libraries for children and presents an analysis of the first seven weeks of its public use on the web. The ICDL hopes to promote literacy and cultural understanding among children through its international collection of books.
412318	41231841	Evaluation of tablet apps to encourage social interaction in children with autism spectrum disorders	The rising diagnosis rates for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have brought attention to the need for effective interventions during childhood to improve independent living later in life. However, most adults with ASDs who received early intervention do not live independently. As a result, there is a demand for new therapies and interventions to help children with ASDs develop social skills necessary for independent living. The launch of the iPad has sparked excitement in the autism community about the potential use of multitouch tablets in interventions. While there are numerous apps marketed as beneficial for children with ASDs, there is little scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. This paper presents a study on the use of a set of apps from Open Autism Software in an afterschool program for children with ASDs. The apps are designed to promote positive social interactions through creative, expressive, and collaborative activities. The study compared activities conducted with and without the apps, finding that children using the apps spoke more, had more verbal interactions, and were more physically engaged. They also made more supportive comments during activities using two specific apps. These results suggest that this approach to using apps can enhance positive social interactions in children with ASDs.
412318	41231843	Vuelta: creating animated characters and props using real-world objects	The article discusses the limitations children face when creating visual stories, as they are often restricted to characters and props available in libraries or must create their own using software. To address this issue, the authors introduce Vuelta, a new tool that allows children to animate real-world objects using a high-definition camera. This enables them to position the characters and props in any direction, promoting creativity and collaboration by allowing multiple authors to participate in the process. The team plans to further develop Vuelta by incorporating editing capabilities and integrating it with a storytelling environment. This approach aims to support children's creativity by allowing them to use objects of their choice and not limiting the types of animations they can create. 
412319	41231946	(Almost) Tight bounds and existence theorems for single-commodity confluent flows	This article discusses the concept of confluent flow, where the flow of a commodity leaves a node along a single edge. It focuses on single-commodity confluent flow problems, specifically the minimization of congestion in routing node demands to a single destination. The article presents approximation algorithms and hardness results for this problem, as well as a polynomial-time algorithm for determining a confluent flow with congestion at most 1 + ln(k) in a directed graph. It also considers a demand maximization version of the problem and shows that the gap between confluent and splittable flows is smaller in k-connected graphs. The existence of confluent flows with low congestion is proven using topological techniques. 
412319	41231924	(Almost) tight bounds and existence theorems for confluent flows	This paper discusses the problem of determining a confluent flow in a directed graph with non-negative demands on its nodes and k sinks. A flow is considered confluent if all the flow leaves a node along a single edge. The goal is to find a confluent flow that routes every node's demand to a sink with minimum congestion. The paper presents approximation algorithms, hardness results, and existence theorems for this problem. The main result is a polynomial-time algorithm that can achieve a congestion of at most 1 + ln(k) in the graph, assuming that there is a splittable flow with congestion at most 1. The paper also considers a demand maximization version of the problem and shows that the gap between confluent flows and splittable flows is small in k-connected graphs. The proof of the existence theorem for k-connected graphs uses topological techniques. 
412319	41231937	The Confluent Capacity of the Internet: Congestion vs. Dilation	The Internet has difficulty handling congestion as it grows, due to the use of shortest paths. These paths are chosen based on dilation and the size of routing tables, but the latter is the main factor for scaling. The paper focuses on the confluent capacity of the Internet, using a model and traffic pattern. The main finding is that confluence can be achieved using a simple algorithm, and simulations show that it is nearly equal to the optimal splittable congestion. The use of expanders and the preferential attachment model also show that confluence does not sacrifice dilation.
412320	41232041	Parallel checkpoint/recovery on cluster of IA-64 computers	ChaRM64 is a high availability parallel run-time system designed for parallel programs on a cluster of IA-64 computers. It uses a user-level, single process checkpoint/recovery library and implements a coordinated checkpointing and rollback recovery mechanism, as well as quasi-asynchronous migration and dynamic reconfiguration. This allows it to effectively handle cluster node crashes and hardware faults. The system has been implemented for PVM on Linux and an MPI version is currently being developed. ChaRM64 is one of the few projects that have been successfully completed for IA-64 architecture. 
412320	41232079	Distributed cache memory data migration strategy based on cloud computing	Cloud computing has become increasingly popular, but with its vast scale comes challenges in scalability and high availability. To address these issues, a recursive N boundary network model is proposed for distributed data storage. A data management model is also developed based on the data center network structure, along with a replica distribution strategy and copy selection strategy to improve data availability and balance loads. A data migration algorithm is introduced to minimize costs and reduce energy consumption, with experimental data confirming its effectiveness. In the edge cloud computing architecture, a data migration strategy and pre-stored data migration strategy are proposed to ensure fast response times and minimize data redundancy. Additionally, a data migration strategy based on network performance is suggested to maintain balance between access network transmission and storage. Overall, these strategies aim to improve the functionality and efficiency of cloud computing systems.
412320	4123206	Hierarchical Cache Directory for CMP.	As technology advances and more processing cores are packed into a single chip with smaller feature sizes, the average access latency for remote nodes using directory-based coherence protocol increases, negatively impacting system performance. Previous methods such as data replication and data migration improve performance for requesting cores but do little for neighboring nodes. Other techniques, like in-transit optimization, reduce latency but require more storage. This paper proposes a hierarchical cache directory for chip multiprocessors (CMP) that divides the chip into regions and combines it with data replication. The new directory organization efficiently records share status within a region and assists the regional home in completing operations. Simulation results for a 16-core CMP show a 9% decrease in average access latency and 34% reduction in on-chip network traffic compared to traditional directory, with less storage. The architecture is also scalable, with theoretical analyses showing that the average access latency asymptotically approaches a function independent of the number of tiles in the CMP.
412321	41232194	A Discriminative Model With Multiple Temporal Scales For Action Prediction	Intelligent systems need to quickly recognize actions in order to react effectively. This is especially important in applications like detecting criminal activity, where decisions must be made based on incomplete videos. A new model has been proposed that can predict the action class from a partially observed video by considering the temporal dynamics of human actions and incorporating both past and present features. This model also enforces label consistency between smaller segments and the overall video. Experiments on public datasets have shown that this approach outperforms other methods for predicting actions.
412321	41232133	Exploring discriminative pose sub-patterns for effective action classification	This study proposes a new approach for effective action classification using articulated configurations of human body parts. The method involves extracting discriminative pose sub-patterns from a set of 3D poses, based on the observation that these sub-patterns frequently appear in specific action classes. The proposed algorithm, called SSPI, simultaneously performs feature selection and learning by identifying and using these sub-patterns as "magnetic centers" for feature transformation. Experimental studies on a large motion capture dataset show the effectiveness of this approach in achieving superior performance compared to existing techniques.
412321	41232166	Early Recognition of 3D Human Actions.	Action recognition is a key area of research in human motion analysis. Recently, there has been a growing interest in 3D observation-based action recognition, thanks to the availability of affordable sensors like the Kinect. This study takes it a step further and focuses on early recognition of ongoing 3D human actions, which has various applications such as gesture-based human machine interaction and somatosensory games. The researchers propose a stochastic process called dynamic marked point process (DMP) to model the 3D action as temporal dynamic patterns, capturing both timing and strength information. They also explore temporal dependency patterns between feature dimensions using a probabilistic suffix tree. Their approach outperforms other methods on five 3D human action datasets, achieving better and earlier recognition results.
412322	4123225	Tractable dataflow analysis for distributed systems	Automated behavior analysis is a useful tool for developing and maintaining distributed systems. This paper presents a dataflow analysis technique that can detect unreachable states and actions in distributed systems. The technique is based on an approximate approach by Reif and Smolka but is more accurate due to the use of action dependency and history sets. While it may not detect all errors, it can efficiently detect nontrivial errors in systems with loops and nondeterministic structures. This makes it a practical and tractable tool for analyzing preliminary designs of distributed systems and can be integrated into software development tools. The technique is demonstrated through case studies and a prototype implementation is presented.
412322	41232217	Structuring parallel and distributed programs	 hierarchiesThe paper introduces Darwin, a language for structuring distributed and parallel programs using groups of process instances that communicate through message passing. Darwin can also express dynamically changing structures during execution. The paper includes examples of using Darwin to construct parallel programs and describes how it can be used to map the hardware structure of distributed memory multicomputers. The approach involves separating the structure of interconnected process instances from the algorithms used to describe individual process types. This allows for context-independent process types with well-defined interfaces, enabling reuse and testing in different contexts. The program structure can be defined using a separate configuration language.
412322	41232236	Enhancing compositional reachability analysis with context constraints	The paper discusses compositional techniques for traditional reachability analysis and how they attempt to address modularity and state explosion problems. Despite achieving modularity, state explosion remains an issue, particularly when a subsystem may contain states and transitions that are not allowed by its context or environment. To address this, the paper proposes a method that includes context constraints in the local subsystem minimisation process. These constraints are specified as interface processes and are used to simplify the subsystem's behavior. This simplified machine can then be used in subsequent steps of the compositional reachability analysis. The paper also explains how these interface processes can be specified and provides an example of their application in a clients/server system.
412323	41232376	An Efficient Policy System for Body Sensor Networks	Body sensor networks (BSNs) are a promising technology for healthcare, where biosensors continuously monitor a user's physiological parameters. Unlike conventional sensor networks for environmental monitoring, BSNs need to be adaptive and easily managed. Security is also crucial in BSNs, leading to the development of a policy system that enables policy-driven management at the sensor level. This system allows for adaptability through dynamic loading and the ability to enable and disable policies without shutting down nodes. It also enables fine-grained access control through authorization policies. The design and implementation of this policy system are discussed, and experimental results show its viability and potential to accelerate application development for BSNs in healthcare.
412323	41232343	Finger: An Efficient Policy System For Body Sensor Networks	Body sensor networks in healthcare require a strong focus on security and adaptability to changing contexts and application needs. Policy-based management allows for flexible and adaptive behavior by allowing policies to be dynamically enabled and disabled without shutting down nodes. This addresses limitations of sensor operating systems like TinyOS, which do not support code modification. Other methods for network adaptation, like networking programming, are costly and disruptive. The policy-driven approach also allows for fine-grained access control through authorization policies. This paper presents Finger, an efficient policy system that enables policy interpretation and enforcement on distributed sensors for adaptation and access control. It is integrated as a TinyOS component with simple interfaces for easy use by developers and has been evaluated for performance.
412323	41232340	Self-managed cells for ubiquitous systems	Ubiquitous computing poses challenges in managing personal wireless devices and sensors. To address this, a policy-based architecture is proposed, utilizing self-managed cells that can adapt and control access based on context and trust. These cells can also organize themselves through federation and nesting. This architecture aims to provide efficient management support for ubiquitous computing at varying levels.
412324	41232462	A Computational Method for Segmenting Topological Point-Sets and Application to Image Analysis	A new computational method has been proposed for segmenting topological subdimensional point-sets in scalar images of any spatial dimension. This method involves calculating the homotopy class defined by the gradient vector in a subdimensional neighborhood around each image point. This neighborhood is defined as a linear envelope created by a given subdimensional vector frame. By using the first largest principal directions of the Hessian, this method can segment critical points such as extrema and saddle points, as well as positive and negative ridges and other types of critical surfaces. The result is a hierarchy of point-sets of different dimensionalities that can be used for geometrical grouping using only local measurements. This method is also efficient and has been demonstrated in two examples where an additional image coordinate or local orientation parameter was used.
412324	41232455	A Dynamic Scale–Space Paradigm	The article presents a new framework for describing the dynamics of physical fields in input images, specifically the optic field dynamics. This framework is invariant under a particular gauge group and yields a concise field description in terms of a set of equivalences or invariants. It is also robust to noise and can be used to analyze physical field dynamics at different scales. The framework is based on initializing joint equivalences for the physical field dynamics and using multi-scale filtering techniques to obtain a hierarchy of nested structures. It can be applied to non-scalar fields and is demonstrated through a time-sequence of satellite images. The article also discusses how this framework can be used to unify existing scale-space paradigms and can be extended to include topological or covariant scale-space paradigms.
412324	41232419	Scale and the differential structure of images	The universal physical law of scale invariance, expressed by the Pi-theorem, explains why and how one should study a scale-space. Any image has inner and outer scale bounds, which leads to the need for a scale-space representation. An early vision system must establish the geometry of its input at any available scale, which requires linearity, spatial shift invariance, and isotropy in the construction of a scale-space. This results in a hierarchical family of scaled partial differential operators, including the Gaussian kernel and its linear partial derivatives. These operators allow for local image analysis and capture global features through the extra scale degree of freedom. The operations of scaling and differentiation cannot be separated, and this framework allows for the construction of multiscale, cartesian differential invariants, which are true image descriptors that are invariant to a change of cartesian coordinates. The scale-space operators are similar to the receptive field profiles in mammalian visual systems.
412325	41232525	Spatio-temporal segmentation using dominant sets	Pairwise data clustering techniques are becoming increasingly popular for image segmentation problems, but they are too computationally demanding for video segmentation due to their scaling behavior with data quantity. This poses a challenge for large datasets, as the number of potential comparisons scales with O(N2), making these approaches unfeasible. To address this issue, strategies to reduce the number of comparisons required by subsampling the data and extending the grouping to out-of-sample points are needed. In this paper, the authors present an approach to out-of-sample clustering using the dominant set framework and apply it to video segmentation. Results show that this approach is comparable to other recent methods in terms of segmentation quality, but much faster.
412325	41232557	Hierarchical Pairwise Segmentation Using Dominant Sets and Anisotropic Diffusion Kernels	Pairwise data clustering techniques are becoming more popular than traditional methods for grouping data based on features. These techniques have shown success in image-segmentation problems. However, they often overlook the benefits of hierarchical coarse-to-fine segmentations, which are common in direct image lattice analysis. In this paper, the authors introduce a new approach to pairwise hierarchical segmentation using dominant sets and an anisotropic diffusion kernel. This allows for scale variation in segment extraction, emphasizing strong boundaries at higher levels of the hierarchy. Experiments on the Berkeley database demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
412325	41232515	Multiview registration via graph diffusion of dual quaternions	Surface registration is an important step in creating 3D objects, but there are limited methods for aligning multiple surfaces. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed which uses dual quaternions to project pairwise alignments onto a common reference frame. This approach allows for a generic topology and is faster and more robust than current methods, even in the presence of noise and outliers. The algorithm can be combined with pairwise alignment for a smoother energy profile and to avoid getting stuck at local minima. Experiments show significant improvements in speed and accuracy compared to existing methods.
412326	41232614	Fast Generation of Random Permutations via Networks Simulation	The paper discusses the problem of generating random permutations with a uniform distribution, specifically on two models of parallel computations: the CREW PRAM and the EREW PRAM. The main result is an algorithm that runs in O(log log n) time and uses O(n 1+o(1) ) processors on the CREW PRAM, which is the first o(log n) -time algorithm for this problem. On the EREW PRAM, a simpler algorithm is presented that generates a random permutation in O(log n) time using n processors and O(n) space. Both algorithms use a random switching network and simulate it on the PRAM model efficiently. This algorithm is an improvement over previously known algorithms for the exclusive write PRAMs.
412326	41232632	Periodic Merging Networks	The article discusses the problem of merging two sorted sequences on constant degree networks using only compare-exchange operations. The traditional solution, Batcher's Odd-Even Merge and Bitonic Merge, runs in log(2n) time and is considered time-optimal due to the lower bound of log n. The article introduces a new family of merging networks that are periodic, meaning each processing unit performs the same operations at steps t and t+k. These networks have a simple architecture and can merge two n-element sequences in O(log n) time for a period of 3. By increasing the period and using additional techniques, the runtime can be improved to 9...log_3 n 5.7...log n for a period of 4 and 2.25...((k+3)/(k-1+log 3))log n 2.25...log n for a period of k+3. These networks also have a small area complexity compared to Batcher's networks.
412326	41232652	Retrieval of scattered information by EREW, CREW and CRCW PRAMs	The k-compaction problem involves moving the contents of k non-empty cells in an array to the first k locations. This has practical uses in processor allocation and load balancing, as well as in parallel algorithms. It is shown that any EREW PRAM algorithm for k-compaction takes (p log n) time, regardless of the number of processors or k=2. On the CREW PRAM, it takes (log log n) time, and on the ROBUST PRAM, it can be done in O(log k) time, even though this is a weaker model.
412327	41232734	Between MDPs and semi-MDPs: a framework for temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning	The challenges of learning, planning, and representing knowledge at different levels of time are important issues in the field of AI. In this paper, the authors propose using options, which are closed-loop policies that allow for actions to be taken over a period of time, to address these challenges within the framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes. Options can be used interchangeably with primitive actions in planning and learning methods. The authors also present results for using options during execution, learning about options, and improving options. These results are established in a simpler and more general setting, without committing to any particular approach, making them applicable to a wider range of problems.
412327	41232779	Using linear programming for Bayesian exploration in Markov decision processes	Reinforcement learning often faces the challenge of balancing exploration of the environment with exploitation of existing knowledge to gain rewards. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with many focused on collecting enough samples to accurately estimate the value function. However, Bellman and Kalaba (1959) suggested a different approach of constructing a representation that pairs states with knowledge about the current model. This approach is only feasible for bandit problems and leads to Gittins indices, an optimal exploration method. In this paper, the authors explore ways to make this approach more computationally feasible by using a Markov Decision Process model and sparse sampling techniques. The resulting optimization problem is then solved using Linear Programming, and the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated on different domains.
412327	4123276	Using finite experiments to study asymptotic performance	The analysis of algorithms involves finding expressions for their complexity, typically using O-notation. While experiments can help with this, they cannot always provide complete mathematical analyses. The scientific method, which alternates between experimentation and theoretical analysis, has been successful in the natural sciences. Experiments can also test hypotheses and provide ideas for theoretical analysis. In some cases, asymptotic behavior can be deduced from strong hypotheses induced from experiments. When complete mathematical analyses are not possible, well-tested hypotheses can be used instead. Five heuristic rules for inferring asymptotic bounds from experimental data are presented, with analytical results for certain families of functions. Experiments confirm the correctness and tightness of these bounds for various functions and real datasets.
412328	41232817	Rectilinear Shortest Paths in the presence of Rectangular Barriers	This paper addresses the problem of finding the shortest L1 path from a given source point to a query point, without crossing any of the given barriers (disjoint isothetic rectangles) in the plane. A previous solution for a restricted version of this problem had a time complexity of O(n2). The authors propose a new approach that involves preprocessing the source point and barriers to create a planar subdivision, allowing for quick traversal from the query point to the source point. By proving the monotonicity of the path in at least one direction, a plane sweep technique is applied to divide the plane into O(n) rectangular regions. The resulting algorithm has a complexity of O(n logn) preprocessing time, O(n) space, and O(logn+k) query time, with an additional O(logn) query time for finding the length of the path. A lower bound of Θ(n logn) is shown for the case where the source and destination points are known in advance, making this algorithm optimal for that scenario. 
412328	41232872	Computing the largest empty rectangle	 empty rectangles with left sides supported by the left edge of the bounding rectangle and right sides supported by the right edge of the bounding rectangle.The problem discussed in this paper is finding the largest empty subrectangle within a given rectangle that does not contain any of the N points it contains. This problem is relevant when trying to salvage fabric or sheet metal with flaws. Previous solutions have taken O(N2) worst-case and O(N log N) expected time. However, this paper presents a more efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(N log N) and a space complexity of O(N log N). The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach and introduces a new concept of Voronoi diagrams and efficient computation methods. It also addresses the special case of finding the largest empty square and presents a solution using Voronoi diagrams. The proposed algorithm recursively divides the points into two halves and determines the largest empty rectangles with support from the bounding rectangle's edges.
412328	41232883	The power of geometric duality	This paper introduces a new way to understand duality in geometry, which allows for the simultaneous solution of multiple geometric problems. Using this approach, the authors were able to solve two longstanding problems in computational geometry: finding the minimum-area triangle among n points in the plane and efficiently determining all points within a given half-plane. The paper describes an optimal algorithm for the latter problem, with a runtime of O(k + log n) and requiring O(n) space and O(n log n) preprocessing time. These results are significant improvements over previous methods. The paper also presents several new results related to the computation of line arrangements.
412329	41232950	Enumerating Global Roundings of an Outerplanar Graph	The article discusses the concept of global rounding in a connected weighted graph, where a hypergraph is created based on the shortest paths in the graph. A real assignment is given to the vertices of the graph and a global rounding is a binary assignment that satisfies certain conditions. The authors of the paper proposed a conjecture that there are at most \V\ + 1 possible global roundings for the hypergraph. The paper proves that this conjecture holds true for outerplanar graphs and provides a polynomial time algorithm for enumerating all the global roundings in such graphs.
412329	41232926	The structure and number of global roundings of a graph	We are looking at a connected weighted graph G = (V,E) and creating a hypergraph HG = (V, PG) based on the shortest paths in G. A global rounding α with respect to HG is a binary assignment where the sum of the absolute differences between the assigned values and the real values is less than or equal to the corresponding value in PG. We hypothesize that there are no more than |V| + 1 global roundings for HG, and that the set of global roundings is an affine independent set. We have found evidence to support this conjecture.
412329	41232928	Combinatorics and algorithms for low-discrepancy, roundings of a real sequence	The article discusses the challenge of computing integer sequences from a set of n real numbers, where the discrepancy between the input sequence and each output binary sequence must be less than one. This problem is relevant in computer graphics for designing digital halftoning methods. The authors present a solution that limits the number of possible roundings to n + 1, and provide an efficient algorithm to report all of them. They also propose a method for constructing a compact graph that represents the set of global roundings satisfying a less strict discrepancy condition. This work has implications for improving digital halftoning methods in computer graphics.
412330	41233032	Variational Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian smoothing of non-linear diffusions	This paper introduces new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian smoothing of partially observed non-linear diffusion processes. The algorithms use a deterministic approximation of the posterior distribution as a proposal for a mixture of independence and random walk sampling. This approximation is obtained by simulating a time-dependent linear diffusion process using the variational Gaussian process approximation method. The algorithms are tested on two diffusion processes and compared to state-of-the-art hybrid Monte Carlo methods. The results show that the new algorithms are accurate and more computationally efficient, except in cases of large observation errors and low observation densities. Overall, the variational approximation assisted sampling algorithm outperforms hybrid Monte Carlo.
412330	41233012	Query by committee	The research proposes a new algorithm called "query by committee" where a group of students are trained on the same data and the next query is chosen based on maximal disagreement. This algorithm was tested on two toy models and it was found that as the number of queries increases, the algorithm provides a finite amount of information gain which leads to a decrease in generalization error. This is in contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, where the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases slowly. The researchers suggest that having a finite amount of information gain may be a significant feature of effective query algorithms. 
412330	41233051	The variational gaussian approximation revisited.	The use of multivariate gaussians to approximate posterior distributions has not been widely adopted in the machine learning community, unlike the use of factorizing distributions. This is due to the large number of variational parameters that need to be optimized, which grows at a rate of Omicron(N)(2) where N is the number of random variables. However, a new approach has been proposed that shows the number of variational parameters can actually be reduced to Omicron(N) for models with gaussian priors and factorizing likelihoods. This technique has been successfully applied to gaussian process regression with non-gaussian likelihoods.
412331	41233120	Redundant bit vectors for quickly searching high-dimensional regions	Audio fingerprinting applications require searching in high dimensions to find similar items in a database. This task often results in negative answers, as many queries do not match any items in the database. To address this problem, a new method called Redundant Bit Vectors (RBVs) is proposed. This method involves approximating high-dimensional regions as hyperrectangles, partitioning the query space, and using bit vectors for efficient storage and searching. RBVs outperformed linear scan and locality-sensitive hashing in terms of speed, especially for large databases and when queries are not frequently found in the database. In a data set of 239369 audio fingerprints, RBVs was 109 times faster than linear scan and 48 times faster than locality-sensitive hashing.
412331	41233149	Scalable summaries of spoken conversations	In this work, a new way of browsing recorded audio conversations is presented. The method allows for scalable summaries of recognized speech, with the ability to increase the amount of text based on the desired level of detail. The interface allows for viewing of the entire conversation on one screen, with the option to zoom in for a full transcript and play the corresponding audio. This is accomplished through a combination of topic segmentation and informative phrase selection, with decreasing informativeness threshold for more detail. A user study was conducted to evaluate the method and interface against a baseline.
412331	41233139	Learning from multi-topic web documents for contextual advertisement	Contextual advertising is a popular form of advertising on web pages, but it presents unique challenges for text mining. Advertisers often want to target or avoid specific content on web pages, which can be difficult to learn due to the need for expensive human labeling at the sub-document level. In this paper, the authors propose using multiple-instance learning to improve the effectiveness of traditional methods for sub-document classification when only page level labels are available. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in two scenarios: sensitive content detection, where advertisers want to avoid certain topics, and opinion mining, where they want to detect and avoid negative opinions about their product. The results show that their proposed system achieves good labeling for free and enhances the performance of traditional learning methods.
412332	41233217	Two-Level Volume Rendering	The paper introduces a two-level approach for volume rendering called two-level volume rendering. This approach allows for using different rendering techniques for different portions of a 3D data set. This means that different structures within the data set can be rendered using different methods such as DVR, MIP, surface rendering, value integration, or nonphotorealistic rendering. These results are then combined globally through a merging step, typically compositing. This approach allows for selectively choosing the most suitable rendering technique for each object within the data set while maintaining a reasonable level of information in the image. This is particularly useful for visualizing inner structures with semi-transparent outer parts, similar to the focus-plus-context approach seen in information visualization. The paper also presents an implementation of this approach, which allows for interactive exploration of volumetric data at high frame rates.
412332	41233210	RTVR: a flexible java library for interactive volume rendering	This paper discusses the design features of RTVR, a Java-based library for real-time volume rendering. The data structures used, based on voxel enumeration, allow for interactive rendering on low-end hardware. By assigning voxels to distinct objects and using individual look-up tables, object-aware rendering is achieved, with the ability to mix different transfer functions, shading models, and compositing modes in a single scene. This approach offers flexibility and extensibility in comparison to hardware-based volume visualization. The memory-efficient data representation and use of Java also allow for volume viewing over low-bandwidth networks with user control over rendering parameters. The paper also addresses challenges specific to using Java for interactive visualization.
412332	41233292	Interactive High-Quality Maximum Intensity Projection	Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is a technique that allows for the visualization of high-intensity structures within volumetric data. It works by taking the highest data value encountered along a viewing ray and depicting it at each pixel. This method is commonly used in medical settings, such as angiography, to extract vascular structures. However, MIP images lack depth information and require animation or interactive variation of viewing parameters for thorough investigation. To address this issue, a new high-quality MIP algorithm using trilinear interpolation within cells has been developed. This algorithm is significantly faster than previous techniques, with a speed-up of up to 50 times compared to brute-force MIP. This is achieved by using a different storage scheme for volume cells and removing non-contributing cells in a preprocessing step, as well as implementing a fast maximum estimation within cells. 
412333	41233348	Multiple Spike Time Patterns Occur at Bifurcation Points of Membrane Potential Dynamics.	In vitro studies have shown that repeated injections of current into neurons can produce a reliable sequence of action potentials. This response can be interpreted as the activity of a group of similar neurons receiving the same input. To study the consistency of this response under different conditions, researchers injected varying levels of current into cortical neurons and found that increasing the amplitude of the fluctuations resulted in more reliable spike times. However, at certain points, small changes in the stimulus caused large shifts in spike times, revealing multiple spike patterns. Increasing the DC offset also increased reliability and produced earlier spike times. Although reliability was reduced at these points, the information about the input was actually increased.
412333	41233389	Attractor reliability reveals deterministic structure in neuronal spike trains	The article discusses the use of periodic current injections in an integrate-and-fire model neuron to study the reliability of spike trains. The results show that the neuron converges to an attractor, producing reproducible sequences of spikes. This attractor reliability is a measure of the stability of spike trains against noise and is quantified as the inverse of the number of distinct spike trains that result from repeated presentations of the same stimulus. This measure can distinguish between neurons that support a spike-time code and those that exhibit a renewal process, which cannot be distinguished using traditional methods. The study also applied these methods to cortical neurons and found that their spike trains had a higher reliability compared to renewal-like processes with the same spike-time histogram.
412333	41233356	Correlation coding in stochastic neural networks	A recent study has shown that the correlation between the spike trains of two neurons in the auditory cortex of marmosets can change without a change in their average firing rates. This can be modeled using leaky integration and fire-and-reset spikes, with balanced input from a common sensory source. The output of the model appears noisy due to stochastic input, but there is a strong central peak in the correlation of the spike trains. This shows that even seemingly noisy spike trains can convey important information about a sensory stimulus through the timing of spikes between neurons.
412334	41233465	Querying capability modeling and construction of deep web sources	This paper discusses the importance of analyzing the querying capability of deep Web sources, which can be accessed through query interfaces. This is crucial for Web applications that need to interact with these sources, such as deep Web crawling and comparison-shopping. The authors propose a querying capability model based on the concept of atomic query, which is a valid query with a minimal attribute set. They also present an approach for automatically constructing this model by identifying atomic queries for a given query interface. The experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of their algorithm.
412334	4123348	Automatic integration of Web search interfaces with WISE-Integrator	The number of databases accessible through Web-based search interfaces is increasing, particularly on e-commerce sites. However, accessing these sites individually can be overwhelming for users. To address this issue, a unified access to multiple e-commerce search engines is important in allowing users to easily search and compare products across different sites. The key to achieving this is by integrating the search interfaces of these engines. Currently, this integration is done manually or semi-automatically, which is inefficient and difficult to maintain. This paper presents WISE-Integrator, a tool that automatically integrates these interfaces using special meta-information and resolving domain differences. The tool also automatically extracts needed information from the interfaces. Experimental results show that WISE-Integrator can achieve high accuracy and produce high-quality integrated interfaces without human involvement.
412334	41233415	Wise-integrator: an automatic integrator of web search interfaces for E-commerce	The article discusses the importance of providing unified access to multiple E-commerce search engines for users to easily search and compare products from various sites. This is currently done manually or semi-automatically, which can be inefficient and difficult to maintain. To address this issue, the authors present WISE-Integrator, a tool that automatically integrates web interfaces of search engines. WISE-Integrator uses advanced techniques to identify and match attributes from different search interfaces, as well as resolve domain differences. Experimental results show that WISE-Integrator can achieve accurate attribute matching and produce high-quality integrated search interfaces without human involvement. 
412335	41233528	Density-Based Clustering over an Evolving Data Stream with Noise	Clustering is an important task in analyzing evolving data streams. Due to limited memory and one-pass constraints, stream clustering must meet certain requirements such as being able to handle outliers and discovering clusters with arbitrary shape. Many algorithms have been proposed for stream clustering, but none have addressed all of these requirements. In this paper, the Den Stream approach is introduced, which uses "dense" micro-clusters to summarize clusters with arbitrary shape and introduces potential core-micro-clusters and outlier micro-clusters to identify clusters and outliers. A pruning strategy is also developed to maintain the precision of micro-cluster weights with limited memory. Experiments with real and synthetic data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.
412335	4123354	Knowledge Discovery in Large Spatial Databases: Focusing Techniques for Efficient Class Identification	The number and size of spatial databases are increasing due to the abundance of data from satellite images and scientific equipment. As a result, automated knowledge discovery is becoming more important. Most current methods for knowledge discovery are based on relational databases, but this paper focuses on using clustering techniques for class identification in spatial databases. The integration of these techniques with the database interface, through the use of the R*-tree spatial access method, is crucial for efficiency. Various strategies for focusing on relevant parts of the database are discussed, and the proposed techniques are applied to a protein database with positive results. 
412335	41233559	A Disc-based Approach to Data Summarization and Privacy Preservation	.The paper discusses the importance of data summarization in database systems and data mining, and introduces a new approach using discs to formalize the notion of quality. The objective is to find a minimal set of discs that cover a given dataset while satisfying radius and significance constraints. Two approximation algorithms are designed, which provide a quality guarantee but do not scale well to large databases. However, a heuristic algorithm is also presented, which uses multi-dimensional index structures and can be integrated with database systems. Experiments show that this heuristic algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of internal and external measures when used as input for clustering methods.
412336	41233623	Uncovering functional dependencies in MDD-compiled product catalogues	A functional dependency is a relationship between attributes in a table of data where the values of certain attributes determine the values of others. This is commonly used in database design and can also be applied to product catalogues. However, traditional methods for identifying functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data, which may not be feasible for large combinatorial catalogues. This paper presents a new approach that uses decision diagrams to efficiently compute functional dependencies in compiled knowledge representations, making it possible to analyze even very large product catalogues. The algorithm was tested on different types of catalogues and revealed potential anomalies that could be useful for improving product recommendations.
412336	41233674	Reasoning about optimal collections of solutions	The challenge of finding the best possible set of solutions to a combinatorial problem is common in various applications. For example, in product configuration, it is important to have a diverse set of solutions to offer to customers. However, due to the complexity of these types of problems, most existing approaches either use heuristics or combinatorial search, which is not practical for large solution spaces. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new method that compiles the problem into a more compact form, allowing for more efficient solution-finding. Their experiments show that this approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness and performance.
412336	41233621	Weibull-Based benchmarks for bin packing	Bin packing is a common problem in many practical scenarios, and this paper focuses on its application in data center optimization. The authors propose a benchmark generator based on the Weibull distribution to create a variety of item size distributions for testing bin packing methods. The results show that this approach accurately models real-world scenarios. They also analyze the performance of systematic and heuristic bin packing methods under different Weibull settings and find that the number of bins required in an optimal solution increases with the Weibull shape parameter. Additionally, they identify a range of Weibull shape settings where bin packing becomes difficult for a CP-based method.
412337	41233722	Preserving mapping consistency under schema changes	The article discusses the challenges of adapting data mappings in dynamic environments, such as the Web, where data sources can change their data, schemas, semantics, and query capabilities. The authors propose a new framework and tool, ToMAS, for automatically updating mappings as schemas evolve. This approach takes into account not only local schema changes, but also changes that may affect multiple components of a schema. The algorithm identifies affected mappings and generates alternative rewritings that are consistent with the new schemas. It also considers user preferences and strives to maintain them as schemas and mappings evolve. In cases where there are multiple potential rewritings, the algorithm may prioritize those that are closest to the existing mappings. 
412337	41233719	A unified model for data and constraint repair	Integrity constraints are important in data design, but in operational databases, they may not always be enforced, leading to inconsistencies over time. To manage this, various techniques have been proposed to repair data by making minimal or low-cost changes to make it consistent with the constraints. However, in modern applications, constraints may evolve over time, making it unclear whether an inconsistency is due to an error in the data or a change in the constraints. This study presents a unified cost model to compare data and constraint repairs and evaluates its effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets. The results show that the repair algorithms are scalable and accurately identify when a data repair or constraint repair is needed.
412337	41233745	Nested mappings: schema mapping reloaded	This article discusses the use of schema mappings in information integration problems. These mappings model the relationships between different schemas, and are commonly used for both relational and nested data. The authors present a new formalism for schema mapping that allows for nesting and correlation of mappings, resulting in more accurate specifications and less redundancy in target data. Additionally, this formalism includes the ability to express grouping and data merging semantics, which can be easily customized for different integration tasks. The authors also introduce a new algorithm for automatically generating nested mappings from schema matchings, and demonstrate its effectiveness in large, highly nested schemas. Using nested mappings in data exchange can significantly reduce execution costs and improve the quality of generated data.
412338	41233834	Performance limitations for linear feedback systems in the presence of plant uncertainty	This paper aims to examine the performance limits for feedback control systems by considering the impact of plant uncertainty. Previous studies have assumed an exact model of the plant, but it is believed that plant uncertainty should also be taken into account. By utilizing stochastic embedding, the paper formulates the problem and provides results that allow for evaluation of the best achievable performance in the presence of uncertainty. This also helps to determine whether uncertainty or other factors, such as nonminimum phase behavior, have a more significant impact on the system's performance. Keywords include performance limitations, stochastic embedding, and uncertainty. 
412338	41233857	On the use of one bit quantizers in networked control.	This paper discusses the problem of determining the best control update rate and number of bits per sample for a control law implemented over a fixed bit rate channel in networked control. The paper considers a restricted architecture with linear filters and a quantizer with linear feedback. A procedure for designing the controller and filters is presented, and it is shown that, under these restrictions, one bit per sample is generally the optimal choice, with the control update rate equal to the bit rate. This analysis differs from previous literature by focusing on bits per unit time and using a fixed number of bits in each time period.
412338	41233880	Robust output-feedback model predictive control for systems with unstructured uncertainty	The paper introduces a new method for designing robust output-feedback model predictive control (MPC) policies for discrete-time systems with constraints and model uncertainty. These policies utilize a linear state estimator, a predetermined feedback gain, and a quadratic cost function. The class of MPC policies includes both well-known and novel policies, all of which satisfy a robust stability test. This test incorporates a novel linear matrix inequality condition involving the cost function parameters, and is always feasible under a small-gain condition on the feedback gain and state estimator. The paper demonstrates through theoretical and numerical results that choosing the cost function parameters according to this condition can result in good nominal performance and robust stability. 
412339	41233910	Soundness of Formal Encryption in the Presence of Active Adversaries	This paper presents a method for proving the security of cryptographic protocols against active adversaries. The method uses a simple logic-based language to express security properties and does not require dealing with probability distributions or asymptotic notation. The paper shows that the method is sound, meaning that logic statements can be interpreted in the computational setting to accurately represent the behavior of an adversary. This is the first paper to provide a framework for translating security proofs from the logic setting to the standard computational setting for protocols with powerful active adversaries. 
412339	41233944	A composable computational soundness notion	Computational soundness results demonstrate that if a system is symbolically secure, it can also be considered computationally secure. However, extending these results to cover new cryptographic primitives often requires redoing a significant amount of work. To address this issue, the authors propose a new concept called deduction soundness. This notion takes into account the use of primitives in the presence of functions specified by the adversary, allowing for easier modular extensions. The authors prove that a deduction sound implementation of certain primitives can be extended to include asymmetric encryption and public data-structures without repeating the original proof effort. This notion of soundness is also applicable to different protocol specification languages, but requires a commutation property to ensure computational soundness.
412339	41233933	Foundations of Non-malleable Hash and One-Way Functions	Non-malleability is a property of cryptographic protocols that ensures the independence of encrypted values. It guarantees that it is difficult to transform an encrypted message into a related one. This concept has been extensively studied in encryption, commitments, and zero-knowledge protocols. However, non-malleability of one-way and hash functions has not been thoroughly explored. This paper introduces a new security definition for non-malleability and shows that it can be achieved using perfectly one-way hash functions and simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge. The complexity of non-malleable functions is also discussed, including their implication of perfect one-wayness and their separation from one-way permutations. The usefulness of this definition is demonstrated in cryptographic applications such as improving the security of encryption schemes and client-server puzzles.
412340	41234051	Examining the technology acceptance model using physician acceptance of telemedicine technology	Organizations worldwide are heavily investing in information technology (IT), making user acceptance a crucial issue in technology implementation and management. While previous research has focused on user acceptance, there is a need for further examination in different contexts. This paper reports on a study that looked at the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in explaining physicians' acceptance of telemedicine technology in the health-care industry. This study was significant as it involved a new technology, user group, and organizational context. Results showed that TAM was able to explain physicians' intention to use telemedicine technology, with perceived usefulness being a significant factor. However, the relatively low explanatory power of the model suggests the need for additional factors or integration with other IT acceptance models. The study has implications for both user acceptance research and telemedicine management.
412340	4123400	Information Technology Acceptance By Individual Professionals: A Model Comparison Approach	The rise of new and exciting information technology applications aimed at individual professionals has sparked a need to re-evaluate existing technology acceptance theories. This study compares the Technology Acceptance Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and a decomposed TPB model in the context of healthcare professionals. Survey data from over 400 physicians in Hong Kong was analyzed and results suggest limitations in using TAM and TPB to predict technology acceptance in this setting. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for specific models and instruments for professionals, rather than relying on those used in ordinary business settings. The implications of these findings for technology adoption research and management practices are also discussed.
412340	41234034	Investingating healthcare professionals' decisions to accept telemedicine technology: an empirical test of competing theories	The use of information technology (IT) has become essential in specialized tasks and services, making it important to understand what factors influence user acceptance of technology. This study focused on physicians' acceptance of telemedicine technology and compared the technology acceptance model (TAM), the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and an integrated model to determine which best explained their acceptance decision. Results showed that TAM was more suitable for examining technology acceptance by individual professionals, and the integrated model did not provide much additional explanatory power. The study also suggests that models and instruments developed for conventional end-users and business managers may not be applicable in professional settings. Overall, this study sheds light on the factors affecting technology acceptance by individual professionals and offers implications for future research.
412341	41234115	A Fast Optimal Robust Path Delay Fault Testable Adder	This paper discusses the complexity of testing the adder function under the robust path delay fault model. The authors prove a lower bound of Omega(n2) for the minimum number of tests required for a complete test set for an n-bit adder. This applies to all known adder designs. They also introduce a fast O(sqrt(n)) adder that can be fully tested for robust path delay faults with a test set of size Theta(n^2). 
412341	412341162	(Quasi-) linear path delay fault tests for adders	.The article discusses the testability of the adder function and proposes a method to reduce the number of tests required. The method is applied to well-known hardware implementations of the adder, such as the Carry Ripple Adder and the Carry Look Ahead Adder. Depending on the structure, the proposed method can achieve a linear or quasi-linear size for a complete timing behavior test of the adder. This makes it possible to perform on-line dynamic testing for many commonly used adders. Overall, the proposed method can improve the testability of adders and make testing more efficient.
412341	41234166	On Optimization-Based ATPG and Its Application for Highly Compacted Test Sets.	Test compaction is a crucial factor in post-production testing as it reduces both test data and costs. However, current automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) methods treat faults independently, limiting the efficacy of compaction. To address this, a new optimization satisfiability (SAT)-based ATPG method has been proposed, utilizing multiple-target test generation and robust SAT-solving algorithms to identify compatible fault groups. This approach can be used for initial compact test generation or as a post-process to improve existing test sets. Experimental results have shown that this method produces highly compacted test sets with high fault coverage for both stuck-at and transition faults, outperforming commercial ATPG tools. In fact, for one industrial circuit, the test set size was reduced to just 26% of the size generated by a commercial tool.
412342	41234238	Property analysis and design understanding	Verification is a crucial aspect of circuit and system design, and formal methods such as bounded model checking (BMC) are effective in ensuring high-quality verification. However, formal verification requires in-depth knowledge of the design implementation and finding the right set of properties can be a laborious and time-consuming task. To address these challenges, this paper introduces two techniques that aid in writing properties for BMC. The first technique helps in analyzing and refining properties to avoid redundancy and handle different scenarios. The second technique, known as inverse property checking, automatically generates valid properties based on the desired behavior. These techniques are integrated with a coverage check for BMC, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined verification process. This ultimately reduces the number of iterations needed for full coverage, saving time and effort.
412342	41234244	Measuring the Quality of a SystemC Testbench by using Code Coverage Techniques	SystemC is a language that allows for the creation of executable specifications for hardware/software integration and design exploration. With the increasing importance of verification in circuit and system design, SystemC's versatility and use of C++ make it easy to build testbenches at different levels of abstraction. However, it can be difficult to measure the effectiveness of these testbenches. In this paper, a methodology for measuring the quality of SystemC testbenches is presented. This approach uses code coverage techniques to identify untested parts of the model and provides feedback to the designer. Case studies of a RISC CPU and a TLM-based video processor demonstrate the applicability of this approach.
412342	41234219	A guiding coverage metric for formal verification	Efforts are being made to ensure the accuracy of circuits and systems through metric-driven verification flows, with coverage metrics being a key aspect. While there are established coverage metrics for simulation-based verification, this is not the case for formal verification, which uses property checking to prove correctness. In this paper, a guiding coverage metric is presented for formal verification, reporting a single number that describes the extent to which circuit behavior is determined by properties. Additionally, a behavior classification algorithm is introduced to identify uncovered behavior classes for a signal, aiding in achieving completeness. The coverage metric for a set of signals takes into account internal signals and can track progress and aid verification engineers in completing the property set. 
412343	41234364	Optimizing Majority-Inverter Graphs With Functional Hashing	The Majority-Inverter Graph (MIG) is a new type of logic representation that allows for efficient optimization. It has been shown to outperform existing approaches in reducing logic depth and achieving superior synthesis results. This paper introduces a new MIG optimization algorithm that uses functional hashing and precomputed minimum MIG representations for functions up to 4 variables. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can further minimize heavily-optimized MIGs in size. When used as a starting point for technology mapping, the optimized MIGs can improve both depth and area for arithmetic instances of the EPFL benchmarks, surpassing the current results of state-of-the-art logic synthesis algorithms. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. 
412343	41234375	Logic Synthesis for Quantum Computing.	The authors propose a synthesis framework called LUT-based Hierarchical Reversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS) to convert classical logic networks into quantum circuits for quantum computing. This framework uses LUT networks to bridge the gap between conventional logic synthesis and logic synthesis for quantum computing. The input to LHRS is a classical logic network and the output is a quantum network realized using Clifford+$T$ gates. This framework allows for a trade-off between the number of qubits and the number of quantum gates. The effectiveness of LHRS is demonstrated by automatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double precision, which can be useful in cost estimation for quantum algorithms targeting scientific simulation applications. The LHRS framework is a crucial step towards understanding the practicality of quantum algorithms in the early stages of quantum computing.
412343	41234374	Ancilla-free synthesis of large reversible functions using binary decision diagrams.	In the past ten years, there has been a lot of research focused on the synthesis of reversible functions. However, most of these methods require large representations, making them inefficient for functions with more than 15 variables. This paper introduces a new approach that uses Young subgroups and symbolic function representations, which can be implemented using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). This approach allows for the efficient synthesis of large reversible functions without the need for additional lines, or ancilla. Additionally, the resulting circuits are much smaller compared to other existing methods.
412344	412344109	Robust sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips.	Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are a promising platform for sample preparation, but errors in fluidic operations can lead to concentration errors. To address this issue, researchers have developed two dilution-chain structures that can generate droplets with desired concentrations even if there are volume variations during droplet splitting. These structures are more effective than current error-recovery methods, which require on-chip sensors and additional time for re-execution. The experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed method in reducing errors and improving efficiency compared to previous methods. This advancement in sample preparation on DMFBs has potential to greatly improve the accuracy and speed of various bioassays and analyses.
412344	41234448	Passive droplet control in microfluidic networks: A survey and new perspectives on their practical realization.	Two-phase flow microfluidics is a promising technology for creating Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) devices, which can perform multiple laboratory functions on a single chip. This is achieved by processing droplets containing biological or chemical samples using different elements on the chip. However, the fixed sequence of elements limits the flexibility and reusability of these devices. To address this issue, microfluidic networks have been developed to allow for programmable and flexible LoC devices. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art in microfluidic networking, including passive switching, network topologies, and validation methods. It also introduces a simple Droplet-on-Demand (DoD) system for generating droplets at specific times and volumes, which is crucial for practical use. The potential applications of microfluidic networks, such as drug screening and waterborne pathogen detection, are also discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting future research opportunities and challenges in this field.
412344	41234492	A Discrete Model for Networked Labs-on-Chips: Linking the Physical World to Design Automation.	Labs-on-Chip are small devices that combine the functions of a traditional laboratory onto a single chip. A new type of Labs-on-Chip, called Networked Labs-on-Chip (NLoCs), uses small droplets of reagents that flow through closed channels in an immiscible fluid. However, the complex flow behavior of these droplets makes it difficult to manually determine their path and time of travel through the NLoC. There are also currently no automated design solutions for NLoCs. To address this issue, a discrete model has been developed that allows for efficient determination of droplet paths and positions in NLoCs. This model has been tested on basic building blocks and a complete NLoC architecture, and can be used for both manual inspection and automated design solutions in NLoCs.
412345	41234548	Bayesian Active Clustering with Pairwise Constraints	This paper focuses on improving clustering using pairwise constraints, which specify similarities between pairs of instances. Randomly selecting constraints can be inefficient and can negatively impact clustering performance. To address this issue, the paper introduces a Bayesian clustering model that learns from pairwise constraints and presents an active learning framework. This framework selects the most informative pair of instances to query an oracle for labels and updates the model based on the obtained constraints. The paper introduces two criteria for selecting informative pairs, one based on uncertainty and the other on maximizing information gain. Experiments show that this method outperforms existing techniques on benchmark datasets.
412345	41234545	Active Learning from Relative Comparisons	This work focuses on active learning using relative comparison information, which specifies the similarity between data triplets. Such constraints have been proven beneficial for tasks like defining distance metrics and finding clustering solutions. However, acquiring these constraints can be time-consuming and requires human effort. To address this issue, the authors propose an information-theoretic criterion to select the most useful triplets for learning with minimum user effort. They also introduce a randomized selection strategy to reduce the number of triplets to be examined, allowing for scalability to larger datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to baseline policies. 
412345	4123455	Active Learning of Constraints for Semi-Supervised Clustering	Semi-supervised clustering is a method that aims to enhance the performance of clustering by incorporating user supervision through pairwise constraints. This paper focuses on the active learning aspect of selecting these constraints for semi-supervised clustering. It proposes an iterative approach where queries are chosen based on the current clustering and existing constraints. The method uses a neighborhood framework, where neighborhoods contain labeled examples from different clusters according to the constraints. The proposed approach utilizes an uncertainty-based principle and introduces a selection criterion that balances the uncertainty of data points with the expected number of queries needed to resolve it. The results show significant improvements over existing methods on benchmark datasets. 
412346	41234650	Reachability under contextual locking	The pairwise reachability problem is a fundamental issue in the analysis of multi-threaded programs, which aims to determine if two control locations can be reached simultaneously during program execution. This problem is crucial for detecting concurrent statements and is typically undecidable, even with abstracted data and finite lock synchronization. However, certain programming paradigms have been identified that make the problem solvable. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm called contextual locking, which restricts lock usage to specific calling patterns within each thread. The main result is that the pairwise reachability problem is decidable in polynomial time for this paradigm.
412346	4123463	Symbolic computational techniques for solving games	This paper discusses the use of games in modular specification and analysis of systems. The authors compare different symbolic computational techniques for determining winning strategies in games that involve reaching a certain state or ensuring safety. These techniques include using symbolic fixed-point computation with ordered binary decision diagrams, checking for strategies within a specified bound by reducing to satisfiability of boolean formulas, and using two different approaches for reducing bounded cases to satisfiability. The authors also demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to safety games and evaluate them using examples and existing tools.
412346	41234638	Explicit and symbolic techniques for fast and scalable points-to analysis	The paper discusses points-to analysis, which is a method used to determine the relationships between variables and memory locations in computer programs. This type of analysis is important for program optimization and debugging. The paper presents two algorithms for achieving fast and scalable points-to analysis, one using a sparse bit-vector set representation and the other using binary decision diagrams. These algorithms were tested on real-life Java applications and were found to be more efficient and use less memory compared to existing approaches. The paper also compares the performance of these algorithms with other methods and shows that they are significantly faster.
412347	41234750	Tracking performance of the RLS algorithm applied to an antenna array in a realistic fading environment	This paper explores the application of frequency domain techniques to the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm in an adaptive antenna array for mobile wireless communication. The RLS algorithm is used to track changes in a fading environment, and the frequency domain approach is applied to the interference canceling problem that arises with antenna arrays in a mobile setting. The results show that using frequency domain techniques can improve the tracking performance of the RLS algorithm in nonstationary environments, making it a promising approach for mobile wireless communication.
412347	41234754	LINKING SEQUENCE BEHAVIOR IN ANC	Adaptive filters have been found to outperform Wiener filters in cases where the reference signal and primary signal have different frequencies. This phenomenon has been explained by the concept of linking sequences. A new study delves deeper into the characteristics of these linking sequences and finds that better performance of the adaptive filter is associated with low variability of the linking sequences. Understanding the behavior of these linking sequences could aid in improving the performance of adaptive filters in noise cancellation.
412347	41234734	Nonlinear effects in LMS adaptive equalizers	.The LMS algorithm, when used in an adaptive transversal equalizer to combat temporally correlated interference, can achieve better steady-state performance than the Wiener filter. This is due to the nonlinear nature of the LMS algorithm, which is not captured by traditional analysis methods that assume independence between filter weight and data vectors. By using a transfer function approach, the authors develop analytical expressions for the LMS mean-square-error (MSE) for different types of interference processes. They demonstrate that the LMS algorithm's superiority over the Wiener filter is influenced by factors such as the signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-interference ratio, equalizer length, and step-size parameter.
412348	41234866	Invariant Features for 3D-Data based on Group Integration using Directional Information and Spherical Harmonic Expansion	As the amount of 3D data increases, there is a need for effective classification and search in databases. However, the varying representations and positions of 3D objects make it challenging to compare and classify them. Invariant features, generated through Group Integration, provide a solution to this problem. Two extensions to this approach are proposed in this paper - incorporating local directional information and using Spherical Harmonic Expansion for more descriptive features. The effectiveness of these extensions is demonstrated through their application to 3D-volume data (Pollen grains) and 3D-surface data (Princeton Shape Benchmark).
412348	41234865	Voxel-wise gray scale invariants for simultaneous segmentation and classification	3D volumetric microscopical techniques, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy, are commonly used in biomedical applications to capture images of 3D objects with complex shapes. However, analyzing these images in high-throughput experiments requires reliable and easy-to-use pattern recognition tools. Most existing tools are specialized to specific problems and require expertise to adapt to new problems. Therefore, the authors have developed a tool that combines object segmentation and recognition using nonlinear kernel functions and support vector machines. This allows biologists to adapt the tool to their specific problem by interactively selecting training points for different classes of objects. The authors also present a fast algorithm for computing these nonlinear functions and demonstrate the tool's effectiveness in recognizing different cell cores of the chorioallantoic membrane.
412348	41234831	Fast scalar and vectorial grayscale based invariant features for 3d cell nuclei localization and classification	The increasing use of fast volumetric imaging techniques in biology and medicine has created a need for efficient image analysis methods to extract quantitative data. One common approach is to use local features, such as group integration, to account for rotation and translation invariance. This study introduces new features that include vectorial information and spherical harmonics descriptors, resulting in a robust detector for spherical structures in low-quality images. These features were successfully applied to 3D confocal laser-scanning microscope images of the Arabidopsis root tip, allowing for the extraction of cell nuclei positions and types. This information can then be used to create a biologically relevant architectural model of the root tip.
412349	41234989	Identity-based online/offline key encapsulation and encryption	The Identity-Based Online/Offline Encryption (IBOOE) scheme splits the encryption process into two phases to make it more efficient for devices with limited computation power. The first phase involves heavy computations, while the second phase only requires light computations and does not require knowledge of the plaintext or receiver's identity. This scheme also allows for preparation of ciphertext without certificate verification. The authors propose new schemes with improved efficiency, assuming random oracles. These include a scheme secure against chosen-plaintext attack and a new scheme called ID-based Online/Offline KEM (IBOOKEM) which splits the key encapsulation process into offline and online stages. Additionally, they present a generic transformation to achieve security against chosen-ciphertext attack. These schemes are the most efficient in terms of online computation and ciphertext size, making them suitable for deployment on devices with limited computation power and expensive communication bandwidth. 
412349	41234990	Practical ID-based encryption for wireless sensor network	The paper proposes a new practical identity-based encryption scheme called RB-OOIBE for wireless sensor networks (WSN). It splits the encryption process into an offline and online part, with heavy computations done in the offline stage and light computations in the online stage. This allows for easier encryption by sensor nodes with limited computation power and storage. The scheme also allows for re-use of offline ciphertexts for the same receiver, limiting the number of offline ciphertexts an encrypter needs to hold. This makes it easier for sensor nodes to send encrypted data, with only a few offline ciphertexts needed during the manufacturing stage and light online computations for the sensor to process.
412349	4123493	An Efficient Identity-Based Online/Offline Encryption Scheme	The paper introduces an efficient Identity-based Online/Offline Encryption (IBOOE) scheme that splits encryption into two phases. In the offline phase, heavy computations are done without requiring knowledge of the plaintext or receiver's identity. This allows for execution on powerful devices. The online phase only requires light computations and can be executed on limited devices like smart cards or wireless sensors. The proposed scheme improves upon previous ones by reducing computation requirements for both offline and online encryption and decryption, as well as producing shorter ciphertext. It is also secure in the random oracle model.
412350	412350126	Learning to handle negated language in medical records search	The use of negated language by medical practitioners to indicate the absence of a medical condition can lead to incorrect results when using traditional information retrieval systems. These systems do not distinguish between positive and negative contexts of terms, resulting in non-relevant medical records being ranked highly. To address this issue, a novel learning framework is proposed that takes into account the context of terms within a document when weighting their relevance. This prevents non-relevant documents from being retrieved. The framework was evaluated using the TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records track test collections and showed significant improvements over existing baselines. When combined with other techniques, the framework can achieve results comparable to the best TREC systems, but does not address other challenges in medical records search.
412350	41235010	Aggregating evidence from hospital departments to improve medical records search	Medical records are difficult to search due to the implicit knowledge they contain, which is known by medical practitioners but hidden from information retrieval systems. This knowledge can be used to improve the search system by ranking patients based on the relevance of their records to a query. The proposed solution is to group medical records from individual hospital departments, referred to as department-level evidence, to capture this implicit knowledge. Two approaches, federated search and voting, are proposed to build this evidence, along with an extended voting technique. Evaluation of these approaches in the TREC 2011 Medical Records track shows improved retrieval effectiveness, comparable to the best systems without requiring external resources. 
412350	412350107	Inferring conceptual relationships to improve medical records search	Medical records contain valuable implicit knowledge that is known to medical practitioners but may not be easily accessible to search systems. For example, when searching for the medical records of patients with heart disease, doctors know that records of patients taking the amiodarone medicine are relevant. In this paper, the authors propose a novel approach that utilizes this implicit knowledge to improve the retrieval effectiveness of medical records search. This is achieved by using a concept-based representation for both records and queries, expanding the queries with additional conceptual relationships, and extracting informative concepts from top-ranked records. The proposed approach was evaluated in the context of the TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records track, showing significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness compared to a baseline approach and comparable performance to top-performing systems.
412351	4123512	A Structured Learning Approach for Medical Image Indexing and Retrieval.	The VisMed approach is a framework for automatic indexing and retrieval of large medical image databases. It involves creating vocabularies of meaningful medical terms and matching images based on their distributions of these terms. This approach allows for both similarity-based retrieval with visual queries and semantics-based retrieval with text queries. By combining the results from both types of retrieval, the VisMed approach achieves a higher Mean Average Precision (MAP) compared to using just one type of retrieval. In a study using this approach on a subset of medical images, the best MAP was 0.2821 for mixed retrieval. 
412351	4123515	IPAL Knowledge-based Medical Image Retrieval in ImageCLEFmed 2006.	The paper discusses the contribution of the IPAL group in the CLEF 2006 medical retrieval task, specifically in ImageCLEFmed. The group's approach involves incorporating medical knowledge into a multimodal fusion framework. This includes using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) for text and semantic features for images, learned through a structured learning framework. The use of UMLS concepts allows for a higher semantic level and standardization of medical data, improving communication between visual and textual indexing and retrieval. Results showed the potential of this approach, especially when using semantic dimension filtering and within a fusion framework. Additionally, a visual retrieval system was tested but showed poorer results compared to the textual approaches.
412351	41235124	Multiplying Concept Sources for Graph Modeling.	This paper proposes a language modeling approach to information retrieval (IR) that incorporates medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) into the process. This is achieved by creating a conceptual representation of each sentence in the corpus using UMLS sources. The resulting graph model is then used to match with the query graph. The study shows that using language model on concepts yields good results in IR, and further improving results can be achieved by multiplying the concept sources and considering relations between concepts. Overall, incorporating medical knowledge in language modeling can improve the effectiveness of IR.
412352	41235225	Lookahead and pathology in decision tree induction	The standard method for creating decision trees involves making optimal decisions at each node without considering future nodes. A new approach was tested where the algorithm looks ahead one level to decide which test to use at a node. This method was compared to the standard method using a large number of artificial data sets. The results showed that the standard method consistently produced trees with the same level of accuracy as the more expensive lookahead method. Additionally, the lookahead method often created trees that were larger and less accurate than those produced without it.
412352	4123525	Efficient Algorithms for Finding Multi-way Splits for Decision Trees	Recent papers have highlighted that binary decision trees may not always be the most suitable model for certain domains. In some cases, it may be more effective to partition a set of examples into multiple groups based on a given feature's intervals. However, traditional decision tree methods only consider bi-partitions. To address this issue, a new algorithm has been developed that can efficiently compute an optimal multisplit of an interval into k sub-intervals, where k is less than the number of examples. This algorithm incorporates a penalty function to prevent trivial partitions. Implementation results have shown that this approach can produce better decision trees for certain distributions.
412352	41235233	OC1: randomized induction of oblique decision trees	The paper presents a new algorithm called OC1 for generating multivariate decision trees. These trees use linear combinations of features to classify examples, with each test being equivalent to an oblique hyperplane. Due to the complexity of finding the optimal orientation for these hyperplanes, heuristics are necessary. The paper proposes a method that combines deterministic and randomized approaches to find good trees. Experimental results on various real-world data sets show that this method consistently produces smaller trees compared to other methods using univariate tests. Furthermore, the accuracy of the trees generated by OC1 matches or surpasses that of other machine learning methods.
412353	41235370	Eco-friendly reduction of travel times in european smart cities	The article introduces an innovative solution for reducing polluting gas emissions from road traffic in modern cities. The solution is based on a new Red Swarm architecture, composed of intelligent spots with WiFi connections that can suggest customized routes to drivers. The proposal has been tested in four European smart cities using a micro-simulator and an evolutionary algorithm. Results show a significant reduction in gas emissions and travel times when vehicles are rerouted according to the Red Swarm indications. This low-cost solution has the potential to engage the interest of citizens and municipal authorities.
412353	412353185	Smart Mobility Policies with Evolutionary Algorithms: The Adapting Info Panel Case	This article presents the Yellow Swarm architecture, a proposed solution for reducing travel times, greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel consumption in road traffic. The architecture uses LED panels to suggest detours for vehicles during different time slots, determined by an evolutionary algorithm designed specifically for this purpose. The algorithm evaluates various scenarios based on real cities imported into a traffic simulator. Results show that even a small percentage of drivers following the panel indications can lead to improvements in average travel times, emissions, and fuel consumption. This suggests that the Yellow Swarm architecture has potential for effectively reducing the negative impacts of road traffic.
412353	4123531	Computing new optimized routes for GPS navigators using evolutionary algorithms.	GPS navigators have become a common feature in vehicles and smartphones, with the main goal being to provide the fastest or shortest route to a destination. However, the widespread use of these devices in a city can lead to traffic congestion as they tend to favor certain streets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a method for calculating alternative routes in order to distribute traffic more evenly and make better use of public resources. This approach has been tested using real road traffic and a simulator, and has shown potential in reducing travel times, greenhouse gas emissions, and fuel consumption. Additionally, the study found that even with just a 10% adoption rate, the proposed method can make a significant impact.
412354	41235420	So-Grid: A self-organizing Grid featuring bio-inspired algorithms	So-Grid is a set of bio-inspired algorithms designed for decentralized construction of a Grid information system. It uses swarm intelligence, where individual entities perform simple tasks but together create advanced intelligence. So-Grid has two main functions: logical reorganization of resources, inspired by ants and termites, and resource discovery, inspired by ants searching for food sources. These functions work together to facilitate intelligent dissemination and efficient discovery of resources. The algorithms are implemented by ant-like agents that autonomously travel the Grid through P2P connections and use biased probability functions. Simulation analysis shows that So-Grid can reduce system entropy and efficiently disseminate content. It also allows users to reach Grid hosts with a larger number of useful resources in a shorter time. This approach has self-organization, scalability, and adaptivity, making it suitable for dynamic and unreliable distributed systems.
412354	41235421	A decentralized ant-inspired approach for resource management and discovery in grids	This paper explores a decentralized and self-organizing approach, inspired by ant behavior, for creating an information system that distributes and organizes metadata for Grid resources. Each "ant" agent uses its own past activity to move and copy resource metadata among Grid hosts, helping to collect similar resources in a specific area of the Grid. This decreases system chaos. A protocol for resource discovery uses the work of these ants, directing client queries to "representative peers" who have information on many relevant resources. The agents control their actions and the queries are sent through the network using self-organizing mechanisms. The research suggests that this approach is effective in organizing resources and making them easily searchable for users.
412354	41235447	Bio-inspired grid information system with epidemic tuning	This paper presents a bio-inspired method for creating a Grid information system, where metadata documents describing resources are distributed and organized on the Grid. The system uses ant-like agents that travel through P2P connections and use probability functions to copy resource descriptors and gather those related to similar resources on nearby hosts. This results in resource reorganization through the collective activity of these agents, which leads to a form of "swarm intelligence". An adaptive mechanism is also implemented to control the dissemination of resources based on user needs. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach effectively balances the two main goals of reducing entropy and replicating resources.
412355	41235531	A field study of API learning obstacles	A study was conducted on over 440 professional Microsoft developers to determine the obstacles they face when learning new APIs. The study found that documentation and other learning resources were the most significant challenges. Five key factors were identified for effective API documentation: documentation of intent, code examples, matching APIs with scenarios, penetrability of the API, and format and presentation. These factors can help prioritize API documentation efforts in order to improve the learning experience and increase programmer productivity.
412355	41235528	Analyzing temporal API usage patterns	Software reuse through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is a key factor in software development. However, as developers work on client programs, their understanding and usage of APIs may evolve over time. To better understand these changes, the concept of Temporal API Usage Mining is proposed. This approach involves analyzing the change history of a client program to detect significant changes in API usage. A framework is described that can extract detailed models showing the addition and removal of API method calls. Machine learning techniques are then applied to these models to semi-automatically identify temporal API usage patterns, such as the consistent addition of API calls at different stages of the client program's life-cycle.
412355	41235542	Asking and answering questions about unfamiliar APIs: an exploratory study	As APIs become larger and more abundant, developers often have to learn unfamiliar APIs for their projects. To better understand the challenges they face, a study was conducted with twenty programmers using unfamiliar APIs for various tasks. Through video analysis and participant feedback, twenty types of questions commonly asked by developers when using unfamiliar APIs were identified. These results provide valuable insights into the difficulties developers encounter when trying to understand and use APIs. This information can be used to evaluate and improve tools designed to aid in API learning.
412356	41235642	Asymmetric rendezvous on the plane	The concept of rendezvous problems involves two players moving on a plane and trying to minimize the time it takes for them to meet. In one scenario, the players are aware of their distance apart but do not know which direction to travel in. Another scenario involves one player knowing the other's initial position while the other player only knows the initial distance between them. Results are also discussed for situations where one player's initial position is randomly chosen from a set of points. Overall, the goal is to find strategies that will allow the players to meet as quickly as possible.
412356	412356100	Traveling salesmen in the presence of competition	The "competing salesmen problem" (CSP) is a competitive version of the traveling salesman problem where two players compete to reach a majority of customers in a given graph. The players take turns moving along edges and know the opponent's position. It is proven to be PSPACE-complete, even in bipartite graphs, with a starting distance of 2 between players. The starting player may not be able to avoid losing, but in bipartite graphs, they can always avoid a loss. On a tree graph, the second player can avoid losing by more than one customer. A polynomial strategy for either player to force this outcome is uncertain. For a star graph with n leaves, there is a simple and optimal strategy for both players. If the customer set includes non-leaf vertices, the situation is more complex.
412356	41235634	On Minimum Stars and Maximum Matchings	This paper discusses the worst-case bounds for the ratio between the maximum matching and minimum median values for finite point sets. It focuses on "minimum stars," which are defined by choosing a center from the given point set that minimizes the total geometric distance to all points. The total length of a maximum matching is a lower bound for the length of a minimum Steiner star, making the worst-case value of this ratio relevant for optimal communication networks. The paper proves a conjecture that in two and three dimensions, the worst-case ratio cannot exceed 3/2 and 5/3 respectively, with tight upper bounds for the Manhattan metric.
412357	41235717	Cutlike Semantics For Fuzzy Logic And Its Applications	Fuzzy sets can be represented by a nested system of ordinary sets, known as a-cuts. There is a lot of research on whether operations and properties of fuzzy sets can be reduced to those of their a-cuts. This includes questions about reducing operations and properties of fuzzy relations and whether a fuzzy concept can be represented by a collection of crisp concepts. Klir and Yuan (1995) refer to this as "cutworthiness". The authors propose a solution to this problem by using a nested system of crisp structures to define the semantics of fuzzy predicate logic. This approach can provide answers to these questions, as demonstrated by examples such as the extension principle and properties of binary fuzzy relations.
412357	41235724	Grouping fuzzy sets by similarity	The paper discusses factorization of systems of fuzzy sets, where sets are grouped based on their pairwise similarity to a prescribed degree. This is a challenge in fuzzy set theory since the similarity is not always transitive. The solution proposed is to consider maximal blocks of sets that are similar at least to the prescribed degree. A natural complete lattice structure is introduced for these blocks, serving as a factor structure for the original system. Examples of this approach include factorization of fuzzy concept lattices and residuated lattices. 
412357	4123574	Bases of closure systems over residuated lattices	The study focuses on closure systems over residuated lattices, which have applications in fuzzy logic. Unlike the Boolean case, there are two non-commuting generating operations, making it more complex. The authors present a decomposition theorem for a general closure operator and use it to compute generators and bases of the closure system. Bases are not unique and can vary in size, but a constructive description of the largest base is given. It is also shown that if the underlying residuated lattice is a chain, all bases have the same size. The problem of computing bases for closure systems in data with grades is discussed, and a method for decomposing closure operators into simpler ones is provided. 
412358	41235878	Taking part: role-play in the design of therapeutic systems	Understanding user needs is crucial in designing effective human-computer interaction (HCI). However, in fields like mental health care, it can be challenging to access end-users. This is due to the sensitive nature of mental illness and the stigma associated with it, as well as the protected therapeutic setting. Role-play, a technique used in HCI, can be useful in these settings. It allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the user's experience, simulate therapy sessions, and train therapists in using technology. This paper explores various role-play formats adapted from therapeutic role-play, drawing upon literature and therapist input. It also discusses the benefits of using role-play in generating empathy and providing feedback on designs. 
412358	41235869	Biological rhythms and technology	Biological rhythms are internal processes that allow living organisms to adapt to and survive periodic changes in their environment. These include variations in the position of the earth and sun. These rhythms, such as body temperature and sleep-wake cycle, are driven by biological processes and can be maintained even without external cues. They have a significant impact on our physical and mental well-being, sleep quality, and mood. However, modern technology does not take these rhythms into account and can disrupt them. To address this issue, the HCI (human-computer interaction) community has been increasingly researching ways to support behavior change, personal insight, and productivity while considering our biological rhythms. This workshop aims to bring together experts in sleep, well-being, and circadian rhythms to discuss the potential of rhythm systems: technologies that align with our biology. The workshop will focus on two areas: measuring and intervening in our biological rhythms with the help of HCI.
412358	41235816	Playing with emotions: sentiment design for public space	This design research focused on finding ways to support emotional expression in interactive games played in a social setting. Rather than measuring emotions, the research aimed to design games that would evoke emotional expression and sharing of personal experiences. The study specifically looked at games played in public spaces, as they have the potential to influence others. Four games were designed based on internal paper prototyping sessions, naturalistic observation, and design and enactment sessions with researchers. The design sessions highlighted the effectiveness of image-based games and the importance of ambiguity and disagreement among players to promote personal storytelling. Other design principles that emerged include short interactions, individual or group play, and the inclusion of elements that can be considered "cheating" in gameplay. 
412359	41235936	Composition attacks and auxiliary information in data privacy	Privacy is becoming increasingly important in data publishing, but there are challenges in reasoning about privacy. One major issue is the auxiliary information that an adversary can gather from other sources, which can breach privacy even with current anonymization techniques. This paper explores how to reason about privacy when faced with realistic sources of auxiliary information. It investigates composition attacks, where an adversary uses multiple independently released anonymized data sets to breach privacy. The experiments show that even simple composition attacks can be successful against commonly used anonymization schemes. However, certain randomization-based notions of privacy, such as differential privacy, are resistant to composition attacks and allow for modular design without explicitly considering other releases. This expands the range of protocols that can be used for privacy protection.
412359	41235942	Discovering frequent patterns in sensitive data	Discovering frequent patterns from sensitive data is a popular technique in datamining, but it carries a risk of privacy violations. This paper introduces two algorithms that accurately discover and release the most significant patterns and their frequencies while protecting individuals' privacy. These algorithms satisfy a new definition of privacy called differential privacy, which ensures privacy even in the presence of external information. To preserve privacy, the algorithms return slightly inaccurate lists of patterns. The paper also defines a new measure of utility to quantify the accuracy of these algorithms' output. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. These techniques are relevant for any data mining output that is ordered according to a robust measure of interest.
412359	41235949	Smooth sensitivity and sampling in private data analysis	The article introduces a new framework for private data analysis, which aims to release aggregate information about a data set while protecting the privacy of individuals. The framework uses instance-based additive noise, where the noise magnitude is determined by both the function being released and the specific database being used. To ensure that the noise does not reveal information about the database, the framework calibrates the noise magnitude to the smooth sensitivity of the function on the database. The article also discusses the challenges and algorithmic questions raised by this framework, as well as providing efficient methods for calculating the smooth sensitivity for different functions and using a sampling-based approach for releasing accurate information on various databases. Finally, the framework is applied to k-means clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.
412360	41236039	Open distributed processing: an architectural basis for information networks	The ODP Reference Model is an important part of the information network architecture being developed by TINA-C. This model is based on key principles and concepts that are crucial for the design and construction of information networks. One of these principles is binding, which is essential for the structure of an information network. A generic binding protocol is also introduced, which can accommodate the diverse types of binding in an information network. Overall, the ODP Reference Model is a significant framework for building efficient and effective information networks.
412360	4123609	The kell calculus: a family of higher-order distributed process calculi	The Kell calculus is a set of distributed process calculi designed for studying component-based distributed programming. It is based on the π-calculus and follows five key principles for a foundational model: hierarchical localities, local actions, higher-order communication, programmable membranes, and dynamic binding. The paper discusses these principles and defines the syntax and operational semantics of the Kell calculus. It also presents a co-inductive characterization of contextual equivalence using strong context bisimulation, and provides examples to demonstrate the expressive power of Kell calculi. 
412360	4123608	Oz/K: a kernel language for component-based open programming	Open distributed programming poses challenges due to the need to consider modularity, security, concurrency, distribution, and dynamicity. This paper proposes a solution that utilizes the concept of locality, which has been successfully applied in distributed process calculi such as Mobile Ambients and Dπ. The proposed approach introduces a kernel programming language called Oz/K, which incorporates the concept of locality from the Kell calculus into the Oz computation model. This allows for a modular, isolated, and passive component that supports open distributed programming. The paper presents an operational semantics and examples to demonstrate the benefits of using Oz/K. 
412361	41236124	Variations in the binding pocket of an inhibitor of the bacterial division protein FtsZ across genotypes and species.	The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria has led to a need for new approaches to drug development. Targeting the mechanisms of action of proteins involved in bacterial cell division, such as FtsZ, has shown promise. However, the mechanism of action and effectiveness of FtsZ inhibitors, such as PC190723, on different bacterial species is not fully understood. Using a statistical method and molecular dynamics simulations, researchers examined the structural environment of the PC190723 binding site on FtsZ. They found that the binding site varies significantly between species, genetic mutations, and polymerization states, providing valuable information for the development of FtsZ inhibitors. This highlights the need for a tailored approach to drug development, taking into account species-specific differences in drug targets.
412361	41236156	Knowledge-based Fragment Binding Prediction.	Target-based drug discovery involves evaluating numerous drug-like compounds for potential activity. Focusing on low-molecular-weight fragments can reduce the search space, but methods for determining protein-fragment interactions have limitations. Experimental assays are time-consuming and expensive, while computational approaches have limited accuracy. With the increasing availability of high-resolution structural data, FragFEATURE, a machine learning approach, uses a knowledge base of protein-fragment interactions to predict fragments preferred by a target protein. It achieves high precision and recall in identifying fragments corresponding to known inhibitors and can aid in fragment-based drug design or compound library creation for screening.
412361	41236181	Clustering protein environments for function prediction: finding PROSITE motifs in 3D.	The growing number of 3D protein structures being produced by structural genomics initiatives lack functional information. To address this, a method called FEATURE was developed for describing microenvironments around functional sites. However, this method is limited to known sites, leading to the development of a new method for clustering protein microenvironments in order to identify novel functional or structural sites. By clustering nearly 2 million environments from 9,600 protein chains, 4,550 clusters were defined and preliminary validation showed the rediscovery of known 3D motifs. This method has potential for discovering new functional sites and can be calibrated using known motifs to find clusters with similar characteristics.
412362	41236292	Coupled-learning convolutional neural networks for object recognition.	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained a lot of attention for their use in computer vision tasks. These networks are inspired by the human brain and have similar properties to its learning process. However, a key difference is that CNNs operate independently while humans rely on effective communication between individuals for their visual system. To address this, a new approach called Coupled-learning Convolutional Neural Network (Co-CNN) has been proposed for object recognition. This method utilizes the dynamic interaction between neural networks to improve their discriminative capability. Unlike other network architectures, Co-CNN optimizes multiple networks simultaneously and incorporates a coupled-learning mechanism to prevent over-fitting. Evaluations on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of Co-CNN over existing algorithms. 
412362	412362105	Joint Bayesian guided metric learning for end-to-end face verification.	The paper addresses the problem of face verification, which involves determining whether two face images belong to the same person or different people. Previous methods have tackled this problem in two separate steps, but the authors argue that this approach does not fully exploit the potential of end-to-end frameworks. They propose a new technique, called Joint Bayesian guided metric learning, which integrates feature extraction and face recognition into a single convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The network is trained on a combination of publicly available databases and then fine-tuned using a metric learning technique. The results of the experiments on the LFW dataset show that this approach achieves high performance in face verification.
412362	41236217	A new recurrent neural network with noise-tolerance and finite-time convergence for dynamic quadratic minimization.	This paper introduces a novel nonlinear integration design formula for solving dynamic quadratic minimization problems with additive noises. Based on this formula, a new recurrent neural network (RNN) called the versatile RNN (VRNN) is developed, which has superior finite-time convergence and noise-tolerant performance compared to the conventional Zhang neural network (ZNN). The paper also provides rigorous mathematical proofs for the global stability, finite-time convergence and denoising ability of the VRNN model. The VRNN model also has a finite convergence time upper bound that is analytically derived. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the VRNN model over the ZNN model in dealing with dynamic quadratic minimization problems with various additive noises. 
412363	412363162	Image coding using dual-tree discrete wavelet transform.	This paper explores the use of 2-D dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) for image coding. Three methods for reducing DDWT coefficients are compared and noise shaping is found to be the most efficient. The dependence among DDWT coefficients is analyzed and three coding methods are evaluated, with TCE performing the best. The DDWT _ TCE scheme outperforms JPEG2000 and other directional filter bank-based image coders. To improve efficiency, the DDWT is extended to anisotropic dual-tree discrete wavelet packets (ADDWP) and is coded with TCE. Experimental results show that ADDWP _ TCE provides even better performance, outperforming JPEG2000 by up to 2.00 dB. The reconstructed images of these schemes are visually more appealing due to the directionality of wavelets.
412363	412363189	Image Compression Using 2d Dual-Tree Discrete Wavelet Transform (Ddwt)	This paper explores image compression techniques using the 2D Dual-tree Discrete Wavelet Transform (DDWT). This transform has direction-selective basis functions and can be further improved through an iterative projection-based noise shaping method. The study examines the statistical properties and dependencies of DDWT coefficients. Two coding methods, SPHIT and EBCOT, are evaluated for compressing DDWT coefficients. Results demonstrate that SPIHT is more efficient than EBCOT for DDWT, and the DDWT-SPIHT method performs better than JPEG2000 at low bit rates and similarly at high bit rates.
412363	41236323	Image and video denoising using adaptive dual-tree discrete wavelet packets	The article discusses the use of adaptive dual-tree discrete wavelet packets (ADDWP) for image and video denoising. ADDWP is an extension of the dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) that further decomposes subbands into wavelet packets with elongated support regions and more orientations. To determine the decomposition structure, a greedy basis selection algorithm is developed, which has lower computational complexity compared to previous algorithms. A statistical model is used to exploit the dependency between real and imaginary parts of the coefficients for denoising. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art DDWT-based schemes for images with directional features and does not require motion estimation for video denoising. The visual quality of denoised images and videos is also improved with this approach.
412364	412364111	Anatomical labeling of the anterior circulation of the Circle of Willis using maximum a posteriori classification.	This paper discusses a method for automatically labeling the arteries that make up the Circle of Willis, a key structure in the brain. This labeling is important for comparing different individuals and identifying risk factors for vascular diseases. The method uses pre-labeled examples and machine learning to detect the five main vessel bifurcations in the anterior part of the Circle of Willis. The labeling process is formulated as a maximum a posteriori solution, incorporating both local and global anatomical variations. The method was tested on 30 subjects and had a success rate of 90%. This technique is effective for labeling the arterial segments of the Circle of Willis and can handle anatomical variations. 
412364	41236469	Temporal diffeomorphic free-form deformation: Application to motion and strain estimation from 3D echocardiography.	This paper introduces a novel registration algorithm, TDFFD, for analyzing motion and strain in 3D ultrasound images. The algorithm enforces time consistency by using continuous spatiotemporal B-Spline kernels to represent the velocity field. The displacement field is then obtained through forward Eulerian integration, and the strain tensor is calculated using spatial derivatives. The algorithm considers both image similarity and a regularization term based on incompressibility. TDFFD was compared to two existing algorithms and showed increased robustness to noise and reduced temporal resolution. It was also applied to a database of cardiac ultrasound images and showed potential for assessing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy outcomes. 
412364	412364116	Pre-clinical evaluation of implicit deformable models for three-dimensional segmentation of brain aneurysms from CTA images	Brain aneurysms are a serious medical condition that requires accurate measurement of their dimensions for minimally invasive surgical interventions using Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDC). Currently, 2D images from Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) are used to obtain these measurements. However, a more precise and objective method is needed. This study proposes a two-stage segmentation algorithm using Implicit Deformable Models to accurately extract the three-dimensional structure of aneurysms and their connected vessels. A comparison was made between manual measurements by neuroradiologists and the automated method using a data set of 40 brain aneurysms, showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique. This highlights the potential of using Implicit Deformable Models in assessing the viability of surgical treatment with GDCs.
412365	4123654	Concurrent flexible reversibility	The concept of concurrent reversibility has been explored in various fields, but has only been limited to a "rigid" form where a past state can be revisited and the same computation can be restarted, even if it leads to a different outcome. In this paper, the authors introduce croll-π, a concurrent calculus that allows for flexible reversibility. This means that alternatives to a computation can be specified and used upon rollback, and these alternatives are attached to messages. The authors demonstrate the strength of this approach by encoding more complex methods for flexible reversibility and showcasing its application in a calculus of communicating transactions.
412365	41236540	Towards a unifying theory for web services composition	Orchestration is a term used to describe the organization and coordination of web services. Many languages have been developed to facilitate this process, with a focus on handling errors through long-running transactions and compensations. The most commonly used language, WS-BPEL, also has a Recovery Framework, but its complexity makes it difficult to analyze formally. To address this issue, the paper introduces webπ∞, a version of webπ that does not consider time, and a related theory. This framework aims to unify different orchestration languages and can fully encode BPEL.
412365	41236517	Mapping Fusion and Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement into logic programming	This paper compares three different formalisms for modeling distributed, concurrent, and mobile systems. These include a process calculus, the Fusion Calculus, graph transformations in the Synchronized Hyperedge Replacement with Hoare synchronization approach, and logic programming. The authors present a translation from Fusion Calculus to HSHR, demonstrate a correspondence between their reduction semantics, and map HSHR to a transactional version of logic programming. This mapping is significant as it highlights the similarities between the two formalisms, particularly in handling name generation and mobility. The use of HSHR as an intermediate step allows for multiple, remote synchronizations, which is necessary for the Fusion Calculus semantics.
412366	41236617	Constrained Equational Deduction	Symbolic computation plays a crucial role in automated deduction, algebraic specification, and declarative programming. In order to design a deduction mechanism within equational programming logic, symbolic equational deduction needs to be extended to incorporate semantic information from abstract symbols. This paper proposes constrained equational deduction as a framework for this extension, within a general constraint equational logic programming framework. By utilizing hierarchical constraint information and linking symbolic equational deduction with various constraint solving mechanisms, constrained equational deduction bridges the gap between symbolic and concrete computation. The paper presents a constructive approach that combines a constraint system with symbolic equational constraints to create the constraint equational logic programming paradigm. Computational models for this paradigm, called constrained equational deduction models, are also introduced.
412366	41236667	Option pricing under model and parameter uncertainty using predictive densities	The theoretical price of a financial option is determined by the expectation of the discounted payoff at expiry time, which is computed using the density of the underlying instrument's value at that time. This density is influenced by the chosen parametric model for the underlying's behavior and the values of its parameters, such as volatility. However, these are typically unknown and therefore, a common practice is to assume a specific model and use point estimates of the parameters to calculate the density. To account for this uncertainty, a method called Bayesian model averaging is used, which combines multiple models and their parameter distributions to generate a predictive density for the underlying. This approach utilizes all available information and eliminates the need for point estimates, making it a more accurate and logical way of pricing options.
412366	4123660	Narrowing and Unification in Functional Programming - An Evaluation Mechanism for Absolute Set Abstraction	The paper discusses how logic programming can be incorporated into functional programming by adding the ability to evaluate absolute set abstractions. This involves introducing logical variables as first class objects in the functional language and using narrowing and unification to solve constraining equations and obtain satisfying instantiations for the variables. The authors also propose a new equality relation, called functional equality, which allows for the use of well-known techniques for equation solving. The main focus is on a specific narrowing strategy called lazy pattern driven narrowing, which is proven to be complete and optimal for evaluating absolute set abstraction. This approach allows for a more expressive language to be developed within a functional programming framework.
412367	41236723	Finding corresponding objects when integrating several geo-spatial datasets	The paper discusses the use of join algorithms in integrating geo-spatial datasets, particularly for finding corresponding objects. It proposes methods that can be applied to multiple datasets and compares two approaches that use object locations. One approach processes datasets sequentially, while the other processes them simultaneously. The paper provides join algorithms for both approaches and evaluates their performance in terms of recall and precision. These algorithms are designed to handle imprecise locations and datasets that do not represent all real-world entities. Results from experiments show that one of the algorithms consistently performs well and outperforms the traditional one-sided nearest-neighbor join. 
412367	41236733	Object Fusion in Geographic Information Systems	This article discusses the use of fusion algorithms to match corresponding objects from two geographic databases. These algorithms only use the locations of the objects and are able to work with imprecise locations and incomplete databases. The performance of four fusion algorithms is measured in terms of recall and precision, and the results show that their effectiveness depends on the density and overlap of the data sources. The algorithms are found to outperform the current state of the art method, with one algorithm consistently performing the best at the cost of a small increase in running time. Extensive experimentation and analysis of the results are presented.
412367	4123670	Efficient integration of road maps	The integration of two road maps involves finding a correspondence between pairs of objects that represent the same real-world road. Existing algorithms for this task are not efficient and often require human input, making them unsuitable for applications where time and space efficiency is crucial. This paper proposes two new algorithms that use only the endpoints of polylines to match roads, rather than attempting to match the entire lines. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach, with high levels of recall and precision.
412368	41236894	A General Framework for Automatic Termination Analysis of Logic Programs	The paper discusses a framework for automatically analyzing the termination of logic programs, focusing on the finiteness of the LD-tree constructed for a given program and query. A general property of mappings from a subset of infinite LD-tree branches into a finite set is proven, leading to various termination theorems. These theorems are then applied to specific cases, such as predicate and atom dependency graphs. The paper also introduces a new method for proving termination in programs involving arithmetic predicates, which combines a finite abstraction of integers with the technique of query-mapping pairs. Several potential extensions to this framework are also mentioned. 
412368	41236889	Proving Termination for Logic Programs by the Query-Mapping Pairs Approach	This paper introduces a method for proving the termination of queries to logic programs using abstract interpretation. The method involves using query-mapping pairs to abstract the relation between calls in the program and query. Any well founded partial order for terms can be used to prove termination. The method has been implemented in SICStus Prolog as a system called TermiLog, which is accessible online. The system can determine if a given program and query pattern will terminate or potentially result in non-termination. This approach has the benefits of being straightforward and not imposing restrictions on programs.
412368	41236853	TermiLog: A System for Checking Termination of Queries to Logic Programs	TermiLog is a system developed in SICStus Prolog that checks the termination of queries to logic programs. It can determine whether a query will terminate or not, and is able to handle 82% of programs tested. The system takes a Prolog program and a query as input and provides an answer on termination. This allows for automatic analysis of program termination, making it a useful tool for developers. 
412369	41236930	Elastic correction of dead-reckoning errors in map building	.The paper discusses a technique called elastic correction that aims to address the problem of imprecision in sensor measures during map building. It involves using a relational graph to represent the environment being explored, with landmarks and inter-landmark routes represented as vertices and arcs respectively. The approach is based on the idea of treating the map as a truss, with each route acting as an elastic bar and each landmark as a node. By taking inconsistent measures and modeling the uncertainty of odometry as elasticity parameters, errors can be corrected through the deformations induced within the structure. This technique shows promise in improving the accuracy of maps created by robots navigating unknown environments.
412369	41236956	Dynamic Clustering of Maps in Autonomous Agents	Spatial knowledge organization and utilization for navigation is a crucial concern in the development of autonomous mobile systems. Dividing the environment map into connected clusters can effectively capture topological features and simplify path-planning tasks. Clustering by discovery is a method for identifying clusters as the agent explores the map, and results in a valid clustering at each step. This study proposes a fitness measure for clustering and presents two heuristic algorithms to maximize it. These algorithms dynamically determine clusters based on topological and metric criteria, with one focused on minimizing entity scattering and the other estimating cluster positions and sizes using a global map of density. The algorithms are compared in terms of optimality, efficiency, robustness, and stability.
412369	41236966	Unsupervised Multi-Agent Exploration of Structured Environments	This article discusses the issue of exploration for autonomous agents in navigating unknown environments. The environment is represented by a graph, with clustering techniques used to create a multi-layered representation. The authors propose an unsupervised exploration algorithm where agents work together to gain knowledge of the environment at different levels of abstraction, using a broadcast communication model. While all agents have the same local exploration strategy, the multi-layered representation allows for different behaviors. Agents dynamically choose their exploration level based on demand, with the goal of replicating an ideal exploration profile.
412370	41237047	Fingerprint Classification by Directional Image Partitioning	This work presents a new method for automatic fingerprint classification. The directional image is divided into connected regions based on fingerprint topology, creating a synthetic representation for classification. Dynamic masks and an optimization criterion guide this partitioning process. The resulting numerical vectors can be seen as a continuous classification of fingerprints. Different search strategies are explored for efficient retrieval of both continuous and exclusive classifications. Experimental results show superior performance and high robustness compared to other existing methods, making it the best approach for continuous fingerprint classification and retrieval. Tests were conducted on commonly used fingerprint databases.
412370	41237040	The Big Brother Database: Evaluating Face Recognition in Smart Home Environments	This paper discusses a preliminary study on template updating techniques for face recognition in home environments. A new database has been created specifically for this purpose, with a focus on variability in pose and illumination. Though the number of subjects is limited, there is a large amount of images available for incremental learning. The process of creating the database and the characteristics of the collected data are described. This database can be valuable for developing and improving face recognition methods for smart homes. The paper also presents initial results on incremental learning and their impact on recognition performance.
412370	4123709	Noninvertible Minutia Cylinder-Code Representation	Fingerprint template protection methods have been proposed, but the issue is still unsolved as protecting the template too much can reduce accuracy. Unlike fingerprint verification, template protection methods are evaluated in various scenarios, making it hard to compare them. This paper introduces a new technique for protecting Minutia Cylinder-Code (MCC), a common local minutiae representation. The proposed algorithm can reverse MCC and recover original minutiae positions and angles. Experiments show that this approach is accurate and provides strong protection against masquerade attacks.
412371	41237130	On the use of words and fuzzy sets	This paper proposes a rethinking of fuzzy sets that does not change their fundamental nature as mathematical entities that extend predicates. The key idea is that predicates organize the universe of discourse, and when this organization is a preorder, a numerical degree can be defined to represent the L-set. The ultimate goal is to expand the current theories of fuzzy sets to encompass language and reasoning, in order to further understanding of the relationship between language and its representations for the advancement of computing with words and perceptions.
412371	41237148	Glimpsing at guessing	The paper proposes a new approach to understanding Commonsense Reasoning, which is seen as a manifestation of the natural phenomenon of "thinking" and a crucial survival skill for humans. The approach utilizes fuzzy sets with a flexible structure and focuses on the concepts of conjecture and refutation. It allows for the definition of informal and formal consequences, as well as hypotheses and creative speculations. The study of Commonsense Reasoning is not limited to logic or mathematics and requires researchers to have a broader perspective. 
412371	41237126	On a New Theory of Fuzzy Sets With Just One Self-Contradiction	Fuzzy Set Theory involves sets that have vague or imprecise boundaries. To avoid contradictions, it is important to only consider fuzzy sets that are not self-contradictory and whose complements are also not self-contradictory. This paper focuses on a specific subset of fuzzy sets, called Fnc(E), which meets these conditions. A Fuzzy Set Theory is then defined within Fnc(E) using appropriate logical connectives. The paper also examines which classical properties are applicable in this new theory. By limiting the sets to those that are not self-contradictory, this theory aims to address issues of consistency and coherence in Fuzzy Set Theory.
412372	41237220	Characterization of Fuzzy Implication Functions With a Continuous Natural Negation Satisfying the Law of Importation With a Fixed t-Norm.	The law of importation is a significant aspect of fuzzy implication functions that has practical applications in fields such as approximate reasoning and image processing. It has been extensively studied and there are open problems related to this property that have been proposed in previous research. In this paper, the authors address one of these open problems by providing a partial solution. They specifically focus on the case of a fixed t-norm and characterize all fuzzy implication functions with continuous natural negation that satisfy the law of importation with this t-norm. The results are detailed for different types of t-norms, including continuous and noncontinuous ones, and also provide characterizations for well-known fuzzy implication functions. 
412372	41237261	Corrigendum to "Fuzzy implication functions based on powers of continuous t-norms" [Int. J. Approx. Reason. 83 (2017) 265-279].	In Massanet et al. (2017), a new property of fuzzy implication functions called the invariance property was introduced. This property is based on the powers of a continuous t-norm and was studied in relation to approximate reasoning. The paper also presented a new family of fuzzy implication functions called power based implications that satisfy this invariance property. However, further research has shown that not all power based implications generated from specific ordinal sum t-norms fulfill this property. Therefore, this paper aims to characterize which continuous t-norms can be used to generate power based implications that satisfy the power based invariance property. Alternatively, a modified version of this property is proposed that ensures all power based implications satisfy it. 
412372	41237214	On Linear and Quadratic Constructions of Fuzzy Implication Functions.	This paper introduces a new approach for constructing fuzzy implication functions using ternary polynomial functions. The linear case is found to only produce trivial solutions, so the quadratic case is investigated further. The quadratic method allows for a variety of possibilities depending on the desired properties of the resulting fuzzy implication function. It is shown that there are countless quadratic functions that can transform existing fuzzy implication functions to maintain properties such as the neutrality principle, identity principle, and the law of contraposition with respect to classical negation.
412373	41237352	Distributed Model Predictive Control	The paper discusses a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme where controllers use model predictive control (MPC) policies to control their local subsystems. These controllers exchange their predictions through communication and incorporate information from other controllers to coordinate their actions. The DMPC scheme ensures stability for controllable systems that satisfy a matching condition by imposing stability constraints on the next state in the prediction. An example application of multi-area load-frequency control is used to demonstrate the performance of the DMPC scheme. The results show that this approach can effectively coordinate the actions of multiple controllers and improve system performance.
412373	41237323	Supervisor Synthesis for Real-Time Discrete Event Systems	This paper presents a formal framework for analyzing and controlling real-time discrete event systems (RTDESs). The framework extends Time Petri nets to controlled time Petri nets (CtlTPNs) and utilizes control class graphs (CCGs) to represent the logical behaviors of CtlTPNs. It is proven that the CCG fully captures the logical behavior of the CtlTPN. A real-time supervisor is then developed based on a nondeterministic logical supervisor for the CCG, with a delay for control computations to ensure acceptability in a true real-time environment. An algorithm is presented to construct the maximal controllable sublanguage of a given specification language. It is also shown that the real-time supervisor meets the desired real-time behavior and an online control algorithm is presented for implementing real-time supervisors. An example of packet reception processes in a communication network is used to illustrate the concepts and algorithms.
412373	4123730	A Relaxation Approach to Dynamic Sensor Selection in Large-Scale Wireless Networks	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have unique challenges in selecting sensors for optimal state estimation due to constraints on bandwidth, energy consumption, and transmission range. This paper presents a dynamic sensor selection strategy for WSNs, using a discrete-time Kalman filter for state estimation. The strategy selects a subset of sensors at each time step to gather data for the next step, based on a criterion of maximizing information gain while minimizing error covariance. This approach is compared to other dynamic and static sensor selection strategies, and is shown to have better state estimation performance for a real-world application of monitoring CO$_2$ sequestration sites.
412374	41237444	Polarized Resolution Modulo	The authors propose a modified version of Resolution modulo where clauses can directly rewrite to other clauses without needing to be transformed into clause form. This requires extending the rules for negative and positive atomic propositions. This method is a combination of clause and literal selection restrictions and can be viewed as a variation of Equational resolution. It is not an instance of Ordered resolution, unlike many other restrictions of Resolution.
412374	41237456	A Completion Method to Decide Reachability in Rewrite Systems	The Knuth-Bendix method is a process that takes a set of equations and rewrite rules and determines if two terms are equivalent based on these rules. A new method has been designed that uses a similar approach, but instead of determining equivalence, it decides if one term can be reduced to another using the given rewrite rules. This has practical applications in proving the decidability of reachability in finite ground rewrite systems and pushdown systems.
412374	41237427	HOL-λσ: an intentional first-order expression of higher-order logic	This article presents a first-order presentation of higher-order logic using explicit substitutions, which is equivalent to the traditional presentation based on λ-calculus. It is shown that the Extended Narrowing and Resolution first-order proof-search method can be applied to this theory, enabling a step-by-step simulation of higher-order resolution. This approach offers a relevant alternative to directly implementing higher-order logic, as it allows for the reuse of well-studied improvements in proof search for first-order logic. Additionally, staying in a first-order setting may make it easier to handle extensions, like equational higher-order resolution.
412375	41237530	Collaborative Metacomputing with IceT	The IceT metacomputing system utilizes collaborative resource sharing, lightweight software frameworks, and efficient execution in heterogeneous environments. It extends the traditional model for distributed computing to enable controlled and secure exchange of hardware and software resources and supports programming paradigms that balance portability and efficiency. The current system is Java-based and allows non-persistent collections of resources, users, and processes to work together for distributed problem solving. The paper discusses the architecture and design principles of IceT, its operational model, and support for executing distributed applications. It also covers the development of subsystems that support the concept of cooperative metacomputing.
412375	41237520	Alternative approaches to high-performance metacomputing	The article discusses the challenges of parallel programming on both tightly-coupled platforms and distributed heterogeneous resources in high-performance computing. It introduces the Harness project, which uses dynamic reconfigurability to address these challenges. The project's core subsystem, H2O, has a "pluggable" software architecture that allows for flexible customization of distributed computing resources without compromising control or security. This is achieved through the use of "pluglets" that can access specialized features of the underlying resources. The article also mentions other subsystems, such as event handling and fault-tolerant naming services, that make up the comprehensive suite of software for metacomputing. The current status, experiences, and future plans for the Harness project are also discussed.
412375	41237576	Icet: Distributed Computing And Java	Metacomputing, also known as distributed processing on networks, has gained renewed interest due to the rise of the Java language and its impact on network programming. However, its applicability in the scientific community is still uncertain. This paper introduces IceT, a new framework for collaborative and high-performance distributed computing that is built on Java. IceT utilizes the strengths of Java, such as portability and scripting, while incorporating established distributed and concurrent computing techniques. This allows for efficient and versatile distributed computing across different platforms and among multiple users. IceT also allows access to specialized processing capabilities and precompiled code. This paper was published in 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
412376	41237652	Graph Treewidth and Geometric Thickness Parameters	This paper discusses the relationship between the classical graph parameter thickness, the geometric thickness, and the book thickness, which are all based on the number of colors needed to draw a graph without crossing edges. The main result is that for graphs with treewidth k, the maximum thickness and geometric thickness are both equal to ⌈k/2⌉. This also applies to the more restrictive setting of geometric thickness. Another main result is that for graphs with treewidth k, the maximum book thickness is equal to k if k ≤ 2 and k + 1 if k ≥ 3. This contradicts a previous conjecture. Similar results are also shown for outerthickness, arboricity, and star-arboricity.
412376	41237628	Layouts of graph subdivisions	A k-stack layout of a graph is an ordering of the vertices and a partition of the edges into k non-crossing sets. A k-queue layout is similar, but with a different partition of edges. A k-track layout involves a vertex coloring and an ordering of each color class such that no edges cross between classes. The stack-number, queue-number, and track-number of a graph are the minimum k values needed to achieve these layouts. This paper looks at these layouts for graph subdivisions and shows that all non-planar graphs have a 3-stack subdivision, with an improved upper bound on the number of division vertices per edge. It also proves that all graphs have a 2-queue subdivision, a 4-track subdivision, and a mixed 1-stack 1-queue subdivision. These values are optimal for every non-planar graph. The paper also characterizes graphs with k-stack, k-queue, and k-track subdivisions for all possible values of k. The results have applications in 3D polyline grid drawings, where it is shown that every graph has a 3D polyline grid drawing with vertices on a rectangular prism and a number of division vertices per edge of $\mathcal{O}({\rm log}{\sf qn}(G))$.
412376	41237645	Graph drawings with few slopes	The slope-number of a graph is the minimum number of distinct edge slopes in a straight-line drawing of the graph. For graphs with a degree of at least 5 and a large number of vertices, the slope-number is at least 2Δ - 1. This is the best known lower bound for graphs with a bounded degree. The slope-number of complete bipartite graphs can be both upper and lower bounded. An upper bound for the slope-number of any graph can be determined based on its bandwidth. Interval graphs, cocomparability graphs, and AT-free graphs have a slope-number that is a function of their maximum degree. Graphs with a bounded degree and treewidth have a slope-number of at most 2Δ - 1. Additionally, it is possible for every graph to have a drawing with one bend per edge and a number of slopes that is at most one more than the maximum degree. In a separate paper, the slope-number of planar drawings of graphs with few slopes is also explored.
412377	41237722	Sequential Feature Explanations for Anomaly Detection.	Anomaly detection systems are commonly used in various applications to detect unusual data instances. However, when presenting the most anomalous instance to a human analyst, these systems often do not provide any explanation as to why it was considered anomalous. This leaves the analyst with no guidance on how to investigate further. To address this issue, researchers have studied the concept of sequential feature explanations (SFEs) for anomaly detectors. These are sequences of features that are presented to the analyst one at a time until enough information is provided for them to confidently determine the anomaly. The quality of an explanation is measured based on the number of features required for the analyst to attain confidence. To evaluate these explanations, a framework has been developed using real and simulated data sets. This has led to insights into various novel explanation approaches.
412377	41237738	Improving Automated Email Tagging with Implicit Feedback.	Tagging emails is crucial in managing information overload. Machine learning can assist with this task by predicting tags for incoming messages, displayed on the email itself. The learning algorithm only receives feedback when it makes a mistake, which can slow down learning. This study aims to determine if implicit feedback, such as user's time spent on an email, can provide additional training for the machine learning system. Three algorithms (and two baselines) were proposed and evaluated using data from 14 users using TaskTracer EP2. The results showed that implicit feedback significantly reduced prediction errors, despite not being perfect. This study concludes that implicit feedback can improve the performance of email tagging systems.
412377	41237797	Real-time detection of task switches of desktop users	The TaskTracer system is designed for desktop users who often work on multiple tasks. It allows users to define a hierarchy of tasks and assign resources to each task, helping with multi-tasking by automatically configuring the computer for the current task. This is achieved through real-time detection of task switches, which is a specialized form of change-point detection. The system uses a classifier to predict the current task based on the window in focus, and combines multiple single-window predictions for more accurate results. Three methods are studied, with the Viterbi algorithm showing the best performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskTracer in improving multi-tasking for desktop users.
412378	41237818	Content-based image retrieval by using tree-structured features and multi-layer self-organizing map	The study presents a new approach for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) using a tree-structured image representation and a multi-layer self-organizing map (MLSOM). The tree structure contains global and local features, providing more comprehensive information for image retrieval. MLSOM efficiently organizes and compresses the image data, allowing for faster retrieval compared to traditional methods. A relevance feedback scheme is also implemented to further improve accuracy. Results show that the proposed system is robust against image alterations and outperforms other CBIR systems in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. 
412378	412378127	A new image classification technique using tree-structured regional features	Image classification is a difficult task in computer vision, and traditional methods use flat features with fixed dimensions extracted from the entire image. However, these features may not accurately represent the image content. This paper introduces a new approach using a tree-structured feature set, where the image is organized into a two-level tree with the root node representing the whole image and the child nodes representing smaller regions. This allows for a combination of global and local features to be used in the classification process. The method uses a two-level self-organizing map, consisting of an unsupervised map for processing image regions and a supervised map for overall classification. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms traditional methods.
412378	41237854	A real-time learning control approach for nonlinear continuous-time system using recurrent neural networks	This paper presents a real-time iterative learning control (ILC) approach for a nonlinear continuous-time system using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying weights. The ILC system utilizes two RNNs, one to approximate the nonlinear system and another to mimic the desired system response. The ILC rule is obtained by combining these two RNNs. A new 2-D training algorithm is developed for the RNNs based on the 2-D system theory, allowing the RNNs to accurately approximate any trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ILC approach. The 2-D RNNs training algorithm expands the application of RNNs in nonlinear continuous-time systems. 
412379	41237970	Multi-Objective Optimization Based on Brain Storm Optimization Algorithm	The paper discusses the development of various evolutionary and population-based algorithms for solving multi-objective optimization problems. The authors propose a new algorithm, called multi-objective brain storm optimization, which uses a clustering strategy in the objective space rather than the solution space as in the original brain storm optimization algorithm for single objective problems. Two versions of the algorithm were tested and the results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in solving different multi-objective problems. The authors conclude that the new algorithm shows promise in solving various multi-objective optimization problems.
412379	41237978	Normalized Ranking Based Particle Swarm Optimizer for Many Objective Optimization.	The paper discusses the issue of comparing solutions in multi-objective optimization problems with more than three conflicting objectives. A simple and effective method is proposed, where solutions are ranked by the sum of normalized fitness values for each objective. Solutions with small values are considered good for minimum optimization problems. To maintain population diversity, solutions with small values and better fitness values are kept in an archive and updated per iteration. This ranking metric is implemented in a particle swarm optimization algorithm and tested on four benchmark problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm is a promising approach for solving multi-objective and many objective optimization problems. 
412379	41237967	Solution clustering analysis in brain storm optimization algorithm	Swarm intelligence algorithms can experience a problem known as premature convergence, where solutions become clustered and fail to diverge again. However, this clustering is not always harmful and can be leveraged in the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm to guide individuals towards better areas. The distribution of these clusters provides valuable information about the search space and can reveal properties of the problem being optimized. This study analyzes and discusses the solution clustering and other properties of BSO. Results from experiments show that BSO is a highly effective algorithm for solving various types of problems.
412380	41238067	Negotiation as an Interaction Mechanism for Deciding App Permissions.	Apps on the Android platform often collect personal data from users, including location, contacts, and photos, and use it as part of their business model. However, many users are not aware of the permission settings or do not make changes to them. This is due to the difficulty of checking and modifying settings for all apps on a device, as well as the lack of flexibility in deciding what happens to their data. To address this issue, the authors conducted a study to explore the impact of more discretionary permission settings at the time of app installation. The pilot experiment showed that allowing users to negotiate which data they are comfortable sharing results in higher satisfaction compared to the traditional all-or-nothing approach. This suggests that negotiating consent can be an effective way to engage users and find a balance between privacy and pricing concerns.
412380	4123802	An Automated Negotiation Agent for Permission Management.	The digital economy relies heavily on data sharing, but individuals have little control over how their personal data is used. As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands, the number of devices accessing and requiring personal data will exceed what individuals can manage manually. To address this, a new approach is needed for managing privacy preferences and obtaining active consent for data sharing. A novel agent-based approach has been introduced to negotiate data sharing permissions between users and services, based on learned preferences from actual users. This approach was evaluated through an experimental tool on smartphones, and it was found that the agent effectively negotiates on behalf of the user without reducing user engagement. Understanding the interaction between individuals and agent-based automation is crucial for successful deployment in real-life and IoT settings.
412380	41238062	Scalable mechanism design for the procurement of services with uncertain durations	This paper explores a service procurement problem where there is uncertainty about whether service providers can complete a task within a specific deadline. The consumer may procure multiple services over time to increase the chances of success, but this requires knowledge of the providers' costs and success probabilities, which they may not willingly disclose. To address this, a mechanism is proposed that incentivizes providers to reveal their true costs and capabilities. Although computing the optimal solution may be difficult in large settings, the paper suggests a polynomial-time solution that performs well in both typical and challenging scenarios. 
412381	41238149	An evaluation framework for assessing the dependability of Dynamic Binding in Service-Oriented Computing	Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is a flexible approach to building applications using distributed services. One of its main advantages is Dynamic Binding, which allows for abstract requests to be connected to specific services at runtime, increasing flexibility and adaptability. However, there is a lack of research on the evaluation of Dynamic Binding Systems (DBS), particularly in terms of system failure and dependability. This paper introduces a new evaluation framework for DBS, utilizing a fault model to simulate potential failures and observe the system's behavior. By treating the DBS as a black box and using distributed components, the evaluation is not limited by the technology or location of the system. Experiments on the NECTISE Software Demonstrator (NSD) show that this framework can detect and provide important information for improving the dependability and performance of DBS.
412381	41238144	Workload Estimation for Improving Resource Management Decisions in the Cloud	Cloud computing can be beneficial for both users and providers if good resource management is implemented. Workload prediction is a crucial aspect in achieving this. While it is possible to estimate the workload of tasks with recurring patterns, it is difficult for tasks without such patterns. This paper proposes a new approach using clustering to group tasks with similar characteristics and use their historical workload data to estimate resources for new tasks. The approach is evaluated using a Google dataset and results show its effectiveness. A workload model is developed based on the dataset and used to estimate the workload of randomly selected tasks from the trace log. This cluster-based method proves to be effective in estimating resources for each task.
412381	41238143	An Approach for Characterizing Workloads in Google Cloud to Derive Realistic Resource Utilization Models	This paper discusses the importance of analyzing behavioral patterns of workloads in Cloud computing environments and the limitations of previous research due to a lack of real-world data. The authors present the first large-scale analysis of real-world Cloud data, using a dataset with over 12,000 servers over a month. They propose a novel approach that considers both user and task in characterizing workloads, which can assist in resource estimation, utilization, and optimization. The approach is evaluated and results show that the model accurately describes the variability of patterns in Cloud computing, making it a valuable tool for emulating dynamic environments.
412382	41238294	Mapping an unfriendly subway system	This article looks at creating a map of a dynamic network, specifically an urban subway system, in less than ideal conditions. The focus is on a team of asynchronous computational entities, or mapping agents, trying to locate black holes in the constantly changing graph of the subway system. The goal is to solve this problem with the minimum number of agents and movements possible. The article presents and analyzes a solution protocol, and also establishes lower bounds on the number of movements required in the worst case scenario, showing that the protocol is move-optimal.
412382	4123827	Distributed Black Virus Decontamination And Rooted Acyclic Orientations	The presence of a black virus (BV) in a network supporting mobile agents is a major threat. The BV can destroy any agent it comes into contact with and can spread to neighboring sites. The objective is to eliminate the BV with the least amount of network infections and agent casualties. Previous research has found a solution for networks with specific topologies, but this paper focuses on networks of arbitrary and unknown topology. The paper presents a decentralized solution using asynchronous agents with 2-hop visibility, ensuring optimal decontamination with minimum casualties and infections. This solution also applies to a related graph optimization problem.
412382	41238244	Finding good coffee in paris	In Paris, it can be challenging to find a good cup of coffee, even at famous cafés. To address this issue, the article proposes a solution for tourists to create a map of the Paris Métro system with the locations of cafés that serve good coffee. This solution is based on the black hole search problem in the subway model, introduced by Flocchini et al. in 2010. It allows tourists to start anywhere and communicate using whiteboards on the subway trains, with minimal information and working independently but collectively. This is the first solution to deal with scattered agents searching for black holes in a dynamic network and is optimal in terms of team size and carrier moves required to complete the map.
412383	41238336	Level-k Phylogenetic Networks Are Constructable from a Dense Triplet Set in Polynomial Time	This paper addresses the question of whether there exists a phylogenetic network that is consistent with a given dense triplet set, and if so, can we construct one effectively. Previous research has provided answers and algorithms for networks of levels 0, 1, and 2, but for higher levels, only partial answers were available. The authors present a complete solution to this problem, using a special property of SN-sets in a level-k network. As a result, they are able to find a level-k network with the minimum number of reticulations, if one exists, in polynomial time. 
412383	41238349	LDFS-Based Certifying Algorithm for the Minimum Path Cover Problem on Cocomparability Graphs.	A minimum path cover (MPC) is a set of vertex disjoint paths that covers every vertex in a given graph G(V, E). This problem is a generalization of the Hamiltonian path problem. Cocomparability graphs are a popular family of perfect graphs that include interval, permutation, and cographs. For every cocomparability graph G and acyclic transitive orientation of its edge set, there is a corresponding poset P-G and an MPC of G is a linear extension of P-G that minimizes the bump number. While there are MPC algorithms for subfamilies of cocomparability graphs, previous algorithms for cocomparability graphs were based on poset formulations. This paper presents the first directly graph-theoretical MPC algorithm for cocomparability graphs, which is similar to the algorithm for interval graphs and has a running time of O(min(n(2), n + mloglogn)). 
412383	41238320	Competitive graph searches	In this article, the authors introduce a new optimization criterion for divide-and-conquer algorithms called generic competitive graph search. They then use this technique to solve two problems in biocomputing: Common Connected Components and Cograph Sandwich. The first problem involves finding the coarsest partition of a set of n vertices that induces connected subgraphs in two input graphs. The second problem is a sandwich problem that aims to find a subgraph that is a partial supergraph of one input graph and a cograph. The authors' algorithm achieves the best known performance for arbitrary graphs and forests, and also improves when the input is made of planar graphs. They also improve the computation time for cograph sandwiches from O(n(n+m)) to O(n+mlog^2n) by using competitive graph search.
412384	41238431	Split decomposition and graph-labelled trees: Characterizations and fully dynamic algorithms for totally decomposable graphs	This paper explores the split decomposition of graphs and presents new findings for the class of totally decomposable graphs, as well as two subclasses: cographs and 3-leaf power graphs. The authors provide structural and incremental characterizations, resulting in efficient dynamic recognition algorithms for changes to vertices and edges within each class. These results are based on a new framework of graph-labelled trees, which represent the split decomposition of graphs. The paper also discusses how this framework allows for a bijective mapping between the graph classes and graph-labelled trees, with labels representing cliques and stars. This approach leads to an intersection model for distance hereditary graphs. 
412384	41238415	Distance labeling scheme and split decomposition	A distance labeling scheme is a way to answer queries about the distance between any two vertices in a graph. Each vertex is assigned a label, and by using a specific function, the distance between two vertices can be estimated based on their labels. This paper proposes a method that combines different types of distance labeling schemes using split decomposition of graphs. This results in optimal label length schemes for certain types of graphs, allowing for constant time distance estimation once the labels are created. This approach is particularly effective for distance-hereditary graphs and other families of graphs.
412384	41238434	Simpler Linear-Time Modular Decomposition Via Recursive Factorizing Permutations	Modular decomposition is a crucial concept in algorithmic graph theory, as it is used to solve a range of important problems such as transitive orientation, graph recognition, and combinatorial optimization. There has been a push to develop a practical, linear-time algorithm for this problem. This paper presents a solution by introducing the concept of factorizing permutations to a recursive approach, resulting in a four-step algorithm that achieves linear-time complexity. The only data structure used is an ordered list of trees, and the steps involve simple traversals of these trees. This approach is simpler and more efficient than previous methods, which either had complex algorithms or relied on impractical data structures. 
412385	41238575	Delineation of rock fragments by classification of image patches using compressed random features	Monitoring the fragmentation of rocks is crucial for the mining industry. Current methods involve physically sieving rock samples or using 2D image analysis software, which is time-consuming and requires skilled operators. Recent research has shown promise in using 3D image processing, but it is not feasible for all mines to switch to this technology. This paper proposes a new method that uses compressed Haar-like features and a support vector machine to accurately delineate rock fragments from 2D images. The optimal image patch size and number of compressed features have been determined through experimentation. Results show that this method outperforms existing algorithms and is more computationally efficient, making it a viable solution for mining companies.
412385	41238582	Classification of Hand-Written Digits Using Chordiograms	The chordiogram method is being explored for identifying shapes in images. This study focuses on using chordiograms to recognize handwritten characters using the MNIST dataset. Each digit is assigned a feature based on the geometric relationships of its boundary pixels. These features are used to train a support vector machine for classification. The study found that using skeleton features extracted through thinning was more effective than using boundary pixel features, with a character recognition error rate of only 2.4%. However, a slightly better error rate of 2.2% can be achieved with boundary pixel chordiograms, though it results in a larger feature vector. This performance is compared to classifying digits based on their pixel intensities.
412385	41238592	Restricted Boltzmann machine approach to couple dictionary training for image super-resolution	Image super-resolution is the process of creating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. In this research, a new method using deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) is proposed for image super-resolution. The RBM architecture is capable of learning visual patterns from training images, which are then used to generate high-resolution images. The algorithm was tested on various images and compared to other techniques. The results were evaluated by both human assessment and quantitative measurements, showing promising visual quality. This approach could potentially improve the quality of low-resolution images and have practical applications in image processing.
412386	41238639	Particle swarm optimisation assisted classification using elastic net prefiltering	A new algorithm has been developed for constructing a linear-in-the-parameters classifier in two stages, specifically for noisy two-class classification problems. The first stage aims to create a prefiltered signal that will be used as the desired output for the second stage. The first stage uses a two-level algorithm to maximize the model's generalization capability, incorporating an elastic net model identification algorithm and particle swarm optimization to select the two regularization parameters. This approach emphasizes the principle of "Occam's razor". The second stage uses an orthogonal forward regression with the D-optimality algorithm to construct the sparse classifier. Extensive experiments have shown that this approach is effective and competitive for handling noisy data sets.
412386	41238641	Nonlinear Identification Using Orthogonal Forward Regression With Nested Optimal Regularization.	The article presents a new algorithm for identifying nonlinear systems using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The algorithm aims to maximize generalization capability by using leave-one-out cross validation. Each RBF kernel has its own kernel width parameter and the algorithm optimizes multiple pairs of regularization parameters and kernel widths, one at a time. This leads to a very sparse RBF model with excellent generalization performance. Unlike previous algorithms, the proposed method optimizes both the kernel widths and regularization parameters within a single procedure, reducing computational complexity. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through examples and comparisons with other popular methods. 
412386	4123865	Radial basis function classifier construction using particle swarm optimisation aided orthogonal forward regression	The researchers have developed a new method for constructing radial basis function (RBF) classifiers with tunable nodes, using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and orthogonal forward regression (OFR). This approach efficiently determines the center and covariance matrix of each RBF node by minimizing the leave-one-out (LOO) misclassification rate (MR) using PSO. Compared to existing methods, the proposed algorithm offers better generalization performance, smaller model size, and lower computational complexity. Additionally, it does not require the tuning of any hyperparameters through costly cross-validation. This new approach has potential applications in various fields, such as machine learning and data analysis.
412387	41238716	Argument-Based expansion operators in possibilistic defeasible logic programming: characterization and logical properties	Possibilistic Defeasible Logic Programming (P-DeLP) is a logic programming language that integrates argumentation theory and logic programming, incorporating possibilistic uncertainty and fuzzy knowledge. It allows for non-monotonic inference, making it useful for modeling complex reasoning. This paper focuses on two non-monotonic operators in P-DeLP that add new weighed facts associated with argument conclusions and warranted literals to a given program, and compares them to a traditional logic system. The analysis of these operators provides a useful framework for evaluating and comparing argumentation frameworks.
412387	41238735	On Warranted Inference in Possibilistic Defeasible Logic Programming	P-DeLP is a logic programming language that combines elements from argumentation theory and logic programming, while also incorporating the treatment of possibilistic uncertainty and fuzzy knowledge. It allows for the modeling of non-monotonic inference, particularly through defeasible argumentation, and offers a way to capture defeasible inference relationships. This paper focuses on a non-monotonic operator for P-DeLP that represents the expansion of a program by adding new weighed facts associated with warranted literals. The logical properties of this operator are compared with those of a traditional SLD-based Horn logic, providing a useful framework for evaluating and applying argumentation frameworks.
412387	41238792	Introduction To Structured Argumentation	Abstract argumentation considers each argument as a single unit without any internal structure, and assumes they are given without specifying what constitutes an argument or an attack. This approach has its benefits for studying argumentation, but it may not cover all our needs for understanding and supporting argumentation. To address this, we can turn to structured argumentation, which uses a formal language to represent knowledge and define how arguments and counterarguments can be constructed. In this approach, arguments have a defined structure with explicit premises and a claim, and their relationship is formally defined. This special issue on structured argumentation covers various approaches within this framework.
412388	41238839	Parallelism and synchronization in two-level metacontrolled substitution grammars	The concept of synchronized substitution is introduced in two-level metacontrolled substitution grammar, as explained in [6]. In contrast to [6], where the top level is independent of the grammar, this mechanism is highly influenced by the chosen grammars. This is exemplified using parallel grammars like E0L systems, and their language-generating capability is compared to ET0L systems and E0L iterated systems.
412388	41238820	From folksologies to ontologies: how the twain meet	Ontologies are tools used to capture and utilize formal semantics, often created through a controlled process. However, the rise of social bookmarking sites, known as folksologies, has introduced a new trend on the Web. Folksologies allow for informal semantics to be created and adopted by anyone on the Internet through the use of tags. Instead of choosing between ontologies and folksologies, there is a need for hybrid emergent semantics systems that combine elements of both. In this paper, the authors suggest analyzing the larger context of semantics and introduce DogmaBank as a proof of concept for a next-generation emergent semantics system. This system combines lexical and conceptual functionalities and is compared to existing examples such as del.icio.us and Piggy Bank.
412388	41238847	Two-level meta-controlled substitution grammars	A new language-generating mechanism, named 2 MSG, is based on the two-level van Wijngaarden syntax used in Algol 68. Its properties are examined and compared to other established systems and grammars. The 2 MSG is a two-level metacontrolled substitution grammar.
412389	41238934	Constructive hypervolume modeling	This paper discusses the modeling of point sets with attributes in geometric spaces of arbitrary dimensions. A point set is a representation of a real or abstract object, while an attribute represents a property of the object at any point in the set. The paper provides a survey of various modeling techniques related to point sets with attributes, such as solid modeling, heterogeneous objects modeling, and volume graphics. Based on this survey, the paper proposes a general model for hypervolumes (multidimensional point sets with multiple attributes) and discusses its components, including objects, operations, and relations. The model uses a function representation approach, where the geometry and attributes are represented by real-valued scalar functions evaluated at points using a constructive tree structure. The paper also demonstrates the application of this model in the context of texturing and discusses its implementation and a specialized modeling language used for hypervolume objects. 
412389	41238915	Constructive function-based modeling in multilevel education	The digital age has greatly impacted the education of children and students, leading to the emergence of new educational technology focused on visual thinking and computer-based tools. This poses a challenge for computer graphics, which has traditionally relied on two paradigms: approximation and discretization. However, these approaches have limitations such as loss of precision and growing memory consumption. To address these issues, a new paradigm of procedural modeling and rendering has emerged, allowing for the creation of complex models using simple operations. This approach aligns with the constructionism theory, which emphasizes active learning and hands-on creation. The use of virtual modeling and graphics tools in education has been found to be effective in teaching mathematical concepts and programming, as well as understanding real-world structures and processes. This approach has also led to the development of qualified students for research and development in this field.
412389	41238953	BSP-fields: An exact representation of polygonal objects by differentiable scalar fields based on binary space partitioning	This study aims to find a dimension-independent algorithm for creating signed scalar fields that accurately represent polygonal objects. The algorithm must meet specific requirements, including having a real function that is zero at the object's boundary and maintains C^1 continuity throughout the domain. The proposed method utilizes binary space partitioning (BSP) and is not affected by the object's complexity or topology. The algorithm can be extended to optimize certain criteria and can be applied to existing objects in CAD and computer animation. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
412390	4123902	Certified Information Access	Certified Information Access (CIA) is a method for users to verify the accuracy of information received from a database. This is achieved by the database owner providing a proof that the information matches the actual content of the database. Existing solutions for this problem require a lengthy setup process. Two secure distributed implementations of CIA are described, one where the database owner distributes the evaluation of a computationally intensive function among untrusted peers, and another where the entire computation is outsourced. The main concern in both cases is ensuring confidentiality and correctness of the data. A new primitive, the Verifiable Deterministic Envelope, is introduced as a potential solution.
412390	41239025	The price of defense and fractional matchings	The article discusses the concept of the "Price of Defense" as a measure of loss in security guarantees due to selfish attacks and defenses in a vulnerable network. The Price of Defense was introduced as a worst-case measure in a strategic game where attackers aim to minimize their chances of being caught and a defender chooses edges to catch attackers. The article presents results that show the lower bound of the Price of Defense is at least half the number of vertices in the graph, and introduces the concept of Defense-Optimal graphs which have a Nash equilibrium achieving this lower bound. It also identifies a graph that is Defense-Optimal but has no Perfect Matching Nash equilibrium. The article suggests that the connection to Fractional Graph Theory may hold the key to understanding the combinatorial structure of Nash equilibria in this security game.
412390	41239052	Simulation-Based Concurrent Non-malleable Commitments and Decommitments	This paper discusses commitment schemes that are secure against concurrent man-in-the-middle (cMiM) attacks. Two notions of security for commitment schemes have been proposed: concurrent non-malleability with respect to commitment and concurrent non-malleability with respect to decommitment. A stronger simulation-based notion of non-malleability has been introduced, requiring that a stand-alone adversary can succeed with the same probability as a man-in-the-middle adversary. This is particularly useful when commitment schemes are used as sub-protocols. The main result of this paper is a commitment scheme that is simulation-based concurrent non-malleable with respect to both commitment and decommitment, protecting against cMiM attacks during both processes. The scheme has a constant number of rounds in the plain model and is the first to have all these properties under the simulation-based definitions.
412391	41239195	Computational Anatomy Gateway: Leveraging XSEDE Computational Resources for Shape Analysis	Computational Anatomy (CA) is a field that uses mathematical and computational techniques to study the variability in biological shape. The key algorithm used in CA is Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), which assigns numerical descriptors and a metric distance to anatomical shapes. CA is widely used in the neuroimaging and cardiovascular imaging communities. The process involves estimating a template and calculating diffeomorphic transformations for each subject in a population. This is computationally expensive and requires parallel computing resources, such as those provided by XSEDE's Stampede cluster. The use of NVIDIA Tesla GPUs and Xeon Phi Co-processors can further speed up these calculations. This will have a significant impact on the neuroimaging and cardiac imaging fields, as these shape analysis tools become available through a webservice (www.mricloud.org) using XSEDE's resources through the Computational Anatomy Gateway.
412391	41239185	Gaussian Random Fields on Sub-Manifolds for Characterizing Brain Surfaces	This paper discusses analytical methods for studying the variation of neuro-anatomically significant substructures in the brain using brain images. Specifically, the focus is on characterizing the shape variation of 2-dimensional brain surfaces through the use of smooth templates. The paper presents techniques for quantifying shape variation in populations, including the use of Gaussian random vector fields. An example is provided of how these methods were used to analyze the shape of the hippocampus in a group of normal and schizophrenic individuals. The paper also presents results from a study comparing hippocampal shape in these two groups and proposes a Bayesian hypothesis test for clustering the two groups.
412391	41239179	Evaluation of group-specific, whole-brain atlas generation using Volume-based Template Estimation (VTE): Application to normal and Alzheimer's populations.	MRI-based human brain atlases are used as a common coordinate system for image analysis and are becoming increasingly important in understanding brain anatomy, image registration, and segmentation. These atlases can be study-specific, obtained from one subject or by averaging images from all participants after registration. However, this approach can result in loss of topology and image contrast due to MR contrasts and residual anatomical variability. A new approach, called Volume-based Template Estimation (VTE), uses a diffeomorphic random orbit model to create a population-representative template without averaging, preserving brain topology. This method was validated using normal and Alzheimer's patient datasets and showed accurate registration and preserved brain topology. This allows for surface-based analysis within the same atlas framework.
412392	4123928	Secure and efficient data transmission in the Internet of Things	The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained popularity in both industry and academia. This concept involves millions of interconnected objects with sensors that collect data and send it to servers for analysis. To ensure the accuracy of this collected data, it is important to establish a secure communication channel between the sensors and servers. In this paper, a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme is proposed to achieve confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and anonymity in a single step. This scheme is proven to be secure against different types of attacks and can be used for data transmission in the IoT, including between different types of cryptographic systems.
412392	41239263	Practical Identity-Based Signature for Wireless Sensor Networks.	Wireless sensor networks require strong security measures, and one important aspect is authentication. A digital signature is crucial for ensuring the integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data. In this letter, the authors propose a practical identity-based online/offline signature scheme specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. The scheme has two phases: offline and online. The offline phase involves heavy computations without knowledge of the message, while the online phase only requires light computations when the message is known. Compared to existing pairing-based schemes, this proposed scheme has the lowest computational cost. 
412392	4123921	Provably Secure Heterogeneous Access Control Scheme for Wireless Body Area Network.	Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a way to collect and transmit physiological information in real time to an application provider (AP). Integrating WBAN into the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem would allow for remote patient monitoring. However, the IoT roadmap still faces challenges, particularly in regards to security and privacy of medical data. In this paper, a heterogeneous signcryption scheme is proposed to address this issue, where the sender operates in a certificateless cryptographic (CLC) environment and the receiver operates in an identity-based cryptographic (IBC) environment. This scheme is then used to design a heterogeneous access control protocol, with formal security proof against chosen ciphertext and chosen message attacks. Compared to existing access control schemes, this scheme has lower computation and communication costs.
412393	41239392	Towards confidentiality of ID-Based signcryption schemes under without random oracle model	Signcryption is a cryptographic method that ensures both confidentiality and authenticity in an efficient way. It is a single step process that offers better computation and communication costs to enhance security. This paper analyzes two different signcryption schemes - one by Yu et al. and another by Liu et al. - under the without random oracles model. The chosen plaintext attacks prove that these previous schemes are not able to resist indistinguishability on chosen ciphertext attacks, thus failing to provide semantic security for confidentiality. This highlights the need for improved signcryption schemes that can effectively resist such attacks and ensure stronger security measures. 
412393	412393101	Reconciling and improving of multi-receiver signcryption protocols with threshold decryption	Signcryption is a cryptographic technique that combines the features of signature and encryption to provide both confidentiality and authentication. It is important for a signcryption protocol to meet the security requirements of indistinguishability against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (ind-cca2) and unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks (euf-cma2). Qin et al. proposed an identity-based multi-receiver signcryption scheme with threshold decryption that claimed to meet these security requirements. However, their scheme is found to be insecure. This paper presents an improved scheme that meets the security requirements and also offers identity privacy for the sender and receiver. The performance evaluation shows that the new scheme has lower communication overhead. 
412393	41239326	Group-oriented setting's multisigncryption scheme with threshold designcryption.	Signcryption is a cryptographic technique that combines the functionalities of signature and encryption in a single step, providing both authenticity and confidentiality. It is more efficient than the traditional signature-then-encryption approach. However, current signcryption schemes only support secure communication between two single users, making it difficult to adapt to group settings with multiple senders and receivers. To address this limitation, the authors propose a group-oriented multisigncryption scheme with threshold designcryption. This scheme uses a combination of threshold secret sharing, zero knowledge proof, multi-signature, and identity-based signcryption to allow a group of users to securely communicate with each other. The proposed scheme is proven to be secure in various models, including semantic security, unforgeability, and public ciphertext authenticity. 
412394	41239417	Adaptive pricing for customers with probabilistic valuations	This paper discusses the problem of determining discriminatory prices for customers with uncertain values and a seller who has identical copies of a product. It is shown that, with certain assumptions, this problem can be reduced to the continuous knapsack problem and a new algorithm is developed to solve it. The algorithm is able to handle asymmetric concave reward functions and can also be applied to pricing problems with overlapping goods. Additionally, a framework for learning customer valuation distributions is proposed and tested on real-world pricing scenarios. The results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms a previously proposed heuristic in terms of speed and accuracy.

This paper analyzes the data from 16 games in the 2006 TAC SCM semi-finals to determine which behavioral features differentiate winning agents from others. It also introduces a metric based on information gain to analyze 80 games in the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals of the 2006 competition. The results show that winning agents in the final rounds made strategic procurement decisions rather than customer bidding decisions. The analysis presented in this paper was used to improve the entry for the 2007 competition, which was one of the six finalists.
412394	41239432	The 2003 Supply Chain Management Trading Agent Competition	 Supply Chain Management involves managing the bidding, production, and procurement activities of various organizations involved in delivering products. The increasing use of electronic marketplaces has led to a demand for automated solutions that can quickly evaluate bidding and procurement options. This paper presents an integrated model that incorporates these activities and discusses its complexity and challenges. A web-based simulation game based on this model was developed and used in the Supply Chain Trading Agent Competition, where teams from around the world competed with each other. The strategies developed by these teams are reviewed and the benefits of competition-based research in this field are discussed.
412395	41239523	Embodiment enables the spinal engine in quadruped robot locomotion	The spinal engine hypothesis suggests that locomotion is mainly controlled by the spine, with the legs providing support. Based on this, a quadruped robot called Kitty was created with a compliant, multi-degree-of-freedom spine and no leg actuation. The study demonstrates how the spine's movements, through embodiment, can generate versatile behaviors such as bounding, trotting, and turning. Information theory was also used to analyze the spine's internal dynamics and its effect on the bounding gait, using three different spinal morphologies. The results showed that a rear virtual spinal joint improved locomotion by allowing more freedom for the rear legs to move forward. The study also discusses the relationship between the robot's behavior and its information structure, which varied based on the spine's morphology.
412395	41239551	The function of the spine and its morphological effect in quadruped robot locomotion	This article discusses the role of spinal movements in locomotion for quadruped animals. Two quadruped models with different numbers of spinal joints were developed to demonstrate spine-driven locomotion behaviors. The models were analyzed in terms of gait properties, showing that employing a spinal morphology with two joints greatly enhances stability and speed. This is achieved by allowing the robot to adjust its center of mass and increasing stride length. The model also exhibits two flight phases and a greater flight proportion during each stride, similar to running cheetahs. These findings highlight the importance of spinal morphology in quadruped locomotion. 
412395	41239511	Spine as an engine: effect of spine morphology on spine-driven quadruped locomotion.	This paper explores the role of the spine in locomotion for quadruped animals. By developing different models with varying numbers of spinal joints, the researchers demonstrate how these joints contribute to controlling body posture and integrating limb and trunk actions. Using a minimalistic control strategy, they analyze the gait properties of these models and find that employing two spinal joints greatly improves stability and speed by readjusting the center of mass, increasing stride length, and generating double flight phases similar to running cheetahs. The researchers also compare models with more spinal joints and find that all resulting gaits can be categorized into three types. Ultimately, the study concludes that a model with two spinal joints is sufficient to emulate biological spine-driven locomotive behaviors.
412396	4123969	Fully automated analysis of padding-based encryption in the computational model	Computer-aided verification is a useful method for assessing the security of cryptographic primitives. However, achieving automated analyses that are effective against computational attacks has been difficult. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting proof systems for analyzing the security of public-key encryption schemes that use trapdoor permutations and hash functions. By combining techniques from both computational and symbolic cryptography, the authors have developed a toolset that allows for fully automated proof and attack finding algorithms. This toolset has been used to create a database of encryption schemes, documenting attacks against insecure schemes and providing proofs with concrete bounds for secure ones.
412396	41239614	Completing the picture: soundness of formal encryption in the presence of active adversaries	This paper extends previous research on the Dolev-Yao model and the computational model by incorporating key exchange and cryptographic primitives, such as signature. This allows for automatic verification of protocols in the computational model using a formal model. The authors introduce a precise definition of security criteria and a reduction theorem which can be used to prove equivalences between security criteria. The proof of the reduction theorem utilizes novel ideas that may have applications in other scenarios. This work has implications for improving the analysis and verification of security protocols in the computational model. 
412396	41239635	Certified security proofs of cryptographic protocols in the computational model: an application to intrusion resilience	Cryptographic systems are essential for securing sensitive information, and it is crucial to ensure their security. Security proofs for these systems can be carried out in different models, each reflecting different types of security assumptions. The symbolic model assumes that the attacker has limited capabilities and cannot guess secrets or perform arbitrary operations. On the other hand, the computational model allows the attacker to guess secrets and use any polynomial-time operation. Proving security properties in the computational model is more challenging and requires specialized tools. This paper presents a framework for certified proofs of computational indistinguishability, using the Coq proof assistant and CIL logic. This approach allows for more comprehensive security proofs that go beyond the traditional black-box framework. The framework is also used to prove the security of a protocol against a specific type of side-channel attack, which models the leakage of information caused by intrusions into the computers of the system's users. 
412397	41239750	Non-revisiting genetic algorithm with adaptive mutation using constant memory	The continuous non-revisiting genetic algorithm (cNrGA) incorporates the entire search history and parameter-less adaptive mutation to improve search performance. However, as the number of fitness evaluations increases, memory management becomes necessary. To address this, two pruning mechanisms, least recently used and random pruning, are proposed to keep memory usage constant. These strategies also serve as parameter-less adaptive mutation operators. Experimental results show that cNrGA with constant memory outperforms other algorithms and can be extended to handle larger fitness evaluations without affecting performance. This expands the applicability of cNrGA to solve more complex problems.
412397	41239730	A genetic algorithm that adaptively mutates and never revisits	The article discusses a novel genetic algorithm that uses a non-revisiting approach, storing all previously explored solutions in an archive. This method uses a unique design of a binary space partitioning tree archive, which not only efficiently prevents revisits but also serves as an adaptive mutation operator without any parameters. The algorithm is evaluated using 19 benchmark functions and outperforms canonical genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization algorithms, and even a state-of-the-art method for adaptive mutation. It can handle problems with large search spaces and has minimal CPU overhead and memory usage. The adaptive mutation feature also demonstrates stable and consistent performance without the need for parameter tuning.
412397	4123975	Parameter control by the entire search history: Case study of history-driven evolutionary algorithm	History-driven Evolutionary Algorithm (HdEA) is an evolutionary algorithm that utilizes the entire search history to improve its performance. It does this by creating an approximation of the fitness landscape and estimating the gradient based on the past history. This allows for adaptive mutation without the need for additional parameters. To further enhance its robustness, a new adaptive parameter control system is proposed as an add-on component to HdEA. This system automatically adjusts the parameters based on the entire search history, eliminating the need for two parameters to be manually set and varied. Tests on 34 benchmark functions show that the proposed system performs similarly or better than the original HdEA in 24 functions.
412398	4123983	Sound and complete relevance assessment for XML retrieval	In information retrieval research, test collections consisting of documents, user requests, and relevance assessments are necessary for comparing retrieval approaches. Obtaining accurate and complete relevance assessments is crucial for this comparison. In XML retrieval, the challenge of obtaining relevant assessments is complicated by the structural relationships between retrieval results. Unlike flat document retrieval, the relevance of elements in XML is dependent on related elements. As such, creating reliable relevance assessments for XML retrieval has been a focus of the INEX evaluation campaign. After trying various methods, the campaign has settled on a highlighting method for marking relevant passages within documents, which has proven to be the most reliable approach.
412398	41239812	The use case track at INEX 2006	The INEX workshop series has primarily focused on developing algorithms for XML information retrieval using test collections from IEEE and Wikipedia. However, a new track called the use case track has been introduced to explore how end-users can utilize XML IR systems for different purposes. This article summarizes the discussions and results of this track.
412398	41239822	Report on INEX 2008	The INEX program aims to improve focused retrieval from structured documents by offering test collections, standardized evaluation methods, and a platform for organizations to compare their performances. This report discusses the results of the 2008 INEX evaluation campaign, which included various tracks such as Ad hoc, Book, Efficiency, Entity Ranking, Interactive, QA, Link the Wiki, and XML Mining. These tracks allowed participants to test their retrieval systems in different scenarios and evaluate their effectiveness. The outcomes of this campaign can help advance the field of focused retrieval from structured documents.
412399	41239940	How well do line drawings depict shape?	This paper examines the use of sparse line drawings in representing 3D shapes. A study was conducted where participants were shown images of 12 objects depicted in 6 different styles and asked to orient a gauge to match the surface normal of the object. Results were compared to ground truth data from a 3D surface model and analyzed for accuracy and precision. The study collected a large data set of 275,000 measurements and found that people are able to interpret certain shapes effectively from line drawings, which can be as effective as shaded images or artist's drawings. Errors in depiction were found to be localized and related to specific properties of the lines used. The collected data will be made available for future studies on this topic.
412399	41239932	Interactive rendering of suggestive contours with temporal coherence	This paper discusses the use of line drawings in conveying shape and proposes the use of suggestive contours, which are lines drawn at specific points on a surface, to improve computer-generated line drawings. The authors extend previous work on static suggestive contours to dynamic and real-time settings and discuss techniques for rendering drawings with contours and suggestive contours at interactive rates. They also analyze the movement of suggestive contours with changes in viewpoint and suggest ways to improve the visual appearance of these contours in both static and dynamic scenarios. 
412399	41239947	Suggestive contours for conveying shape	This paper introduces a non-photorealistic rendering system that uses lines to convey shape. It introduces a new type of line, suggestive contour, which is drawn on clearly visible parts of the surface where a true contour would first appear with a minimal change in viewpoint. The paper provides two methods for calculating suggestive contours and presents results that show how these lines can effectively convey shape. The algorithm used can find the zero crossings of the radial curvature and these suggestive contours can be drawn consistently with true contours, extending and anticipating them. The authors argue that images with suggestive contours are more effective at conveying shape than those with contours alone.
412400	41240054	Design and fabrication of materials with desired deformation behavior	This paper presents a data-driven approach for designing and creating materials with specific deformation properties. The process involves measuring the deformation properties of base materials and using this information to create a non-linear stress-strain relationship in a finite-element model. The validity of this measurement process is confirmed by comparing simulated and actual deformations of fabricated material stacks. Then, an optimization process is used to design layered combinations of base materials that meet desired deformation criteria. Various strategies are employed to streamline the search for optimal solutions. The complete process is demonstrated by designing and fabricating objects using modern multi-material 3D printers.
412400	412400101	Data-driven finite elements for geometry and material design	Crafting the behavior of a deformable object, whether it is a biomechanically accurate character model or a new 3D printable design, is a challenging task that requires constant iteration. Previous algorithms for accelerating three-dimensional finite element analysis suffer from expensive precomputation stages that rely on prior knowledge of the object's geometry and material composition. In this paper, a new method called Data-Driven Finite Elements is introduced to address this issue. This method constructs a reusable library of metamaterials based on a given material palette, allowing for fast coarsening of simulation meshes at runtime. The method is applicable to non-linear material models and has been shown to yield significant speed gains while maintaining accuracy. Examples of its effectiveness are demonstrated on both virtual and 3D printed objects. 
412400	41240043	Experimental analysis of BRDF models	The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is a way to describe how a material interacts with light at a surface point. There are various analytical models that have been proposed to represent BRDFs, but there has been limited analysis of their performance due to a lack of high-resolution data. In this study, several well-known analytical models were evaluated using a high-resolution dataset of 100 isotropic materials. The study also involved creating a new setup for efficiently measuring anisotropic BRDFs, and four samples of anisotropic materials were measured. Results showed that physically-based analytic models can accurately represent the appearance of most isotropic materials, especially when defining the specular lobe with respect to the half-vector. However, current parametric models struggle to accurately represent anisotropic materials, but using a sampled microfacet distribution derived from measurements can improve the fit.
412401	41240140	Evolving mach 3.0 to a migrating thread model	The authors have made changes to the Mach 3.0 operating system to improve its handling of cross-domain remote procedure calls (RPCs). This involves treating RPCs as a single entity instead of a sequence of message passing operations, and using a migrating thread model instead of a static one. This model allows for better transfer of control during RPCs and simplifies kernel code. The new system also provides more control over thread manipulation and improves RPC performance. The authors have kept the old thread and IPC interfaces for compatibility and have demonstrated the effectiveness of their changes with a functional Unix server and clients. The changes have reduced logical complexity and improved local RPC performance. They conclude that the migrating thread model and kernel-visible RPC are beneficial for improving operating systems. 
412401	41240119	Vx32: lightweight user-level sandboxing on the x86	Code sandboxing is a useful tool for isolating and executing potentially untrusted code within an application. However, many existing sandboxing techniques have limitations such as requiring kernel modifications, not fully isolating the guest code, or causing significant performance costs. Vx32 is a user-level sandbox that addresses these issues by using x86 segmentation hardware and a lightweight instruction translator. It allows an application to safely load and execute guest plug-ins within a restricted memory region, and control the guest's access to system calls and instructions. Vx32 has been evaluated through microbenchmarks and whole system benchmarks, and has been successfully used in various applications including an archival storage system, a public-key infrastructure, and an experimental user-level operating system. While it may incur some overhead, it is still more efficient than other virtual machine monitors and does not require kernel modifications.
412401	41240118	In-Kernel Servers on Mach 3.0: Implementation and Performance	Microkernel-based operating systems, like Mach 3.0, have advantages in modularity and power. However, their existing performance problems are significant. This is due to the cost of maintaining separate protection domains, traversing software layers, and using a complex inter-process communication mechanism. To optimize performance, a system has been developed that allows merging of protection domains in performance critical applications, while still maintaining protection boundaries for debugging and robustness. This is achieved by binding client calls to either a simple system call interface or a full RPC mechanism, depending on the server's location. The system has been successfully implemented on Mach 3.0 and OSF/1, with minimal modifications and no loss of compatibility or performance. On benchmark tests, RPC performance improved by three times, while Unix system calls to the server saw a 20-100% improvement, and overall performance gains of 4-13% were achieved.
412402	4124020	Coupled binary embedding for large-scale image retrieval.	Visual matching is a crucial part of image retrieval using the bag-of-words (BoW) model. However, the traditional method of matching based on SIFT descriptors has limitations in terms of discriminative power and only describing local texture features. To address this issue, this paper proposes incorporating multiple binary features at the indexing level and using a multi-IDF scheme to model their correlation. This allows for the integration of binary feature-based matching methods, like Hamming embedding, into the framework. The inclusion of binary color features also improves the precision of visual matching and reduces the impact of false positive matches. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that this method outperforms the traditional approach and requires acceptable memory usage and query time. When global color features are also integrated, the proposed method performs competitively with other state-of-the-art methods. 
412402	41240211	Packing and Padding: Coupled Multi-index for Accurate Image Retrieval	The Bag-of-Words (BoW) based image retrieval method often results in false positive matches due to the low discriminative power of the SIFT visual word. This is because the SIFT feature only describes the local gradient distribution and there is information loss during quantization. To address this issue, a coupled Multi-Index (c-MI) framework is proposed for feature fusion at the indexing level. This involves coupling complementary features into a multi-dimensional inverted index, with each dimension corresponding to a specific feature. The fusion of local color features is also incorporated, improving both precision and recall. Experimental results show that c-MI significantly improves retrieval accuracy and is complementary to other techniques. It achieves high scores on benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
412402	41240249	Fast Image Retrieval: Query Pruning and Early Termination	This paper proposes a fast image retrieval framework to improve efficiency in the online retrieval process. It introduces an impact score for local features that takes into account various properties such as TF-IDF, scale, saliency, and ambiguity. This score is then quantized to an integer to reduce memory consumption and a new inverted index organization, called Q-Index, is created. The framework also includes two strategies, query pruning and early termination, which discard less important features and only visit high impact score features in the inverted index, respectively. This approach was tested on two benchmark datasets and was shown to significantly reduce the number of features that need to be visited, resulting in faster query times and competitive retrieval accuracy. 
412403	41240388	Texture Features for Browsing and Retrieval of Image Data	Image content based retrieval is a growing field that has practical applications in digital libraries and multimedia databases. This paper specifically focuses on the use of texture information for browsing and retrieving large volumes of images. The authors propose using Gabor wavelet features for texture analysis and provide a thorough evaluation of their effectiveness. Results show that Gabor features outperform other texture features when applied to the Brodatz texture database, demonstrating their accuracy in pattern retrieval. An example of using this approach for browsing large air photos is also presented. 
412403	412403124	Color and texture descriptors	This paper provides an overview of approved color and texture descriptors for the MPEG-7 standard. These descriptors have been extensively evaluated and developed in the past two years, with evaluation criteria including their effectiveness in similarity retrieval, extraction, storage, and representation complexities. The color descriptors in the standard include a coded histogram using the Haar transform, a color structure histogram, a dominant color descriptor, and a color layout descriptor. Three texture descriptors are also included, one for characterizing homogeneous texture regions, one for local edge distribution, and a compact descriptor for texture browsing. Each descriptor is explained in detail, including their semantics, extraction, and usage. The effectiveness of these descriptors is supported by experimental results. 
412403	41240326	A texture thesaurus for browsing large aerial photographs	The article discusses a texture-based image retrieval system designed for browsing large-scale aerial photographs. The system utilizes several components, including texture feature extraction, image segmentation and grouping, and a texture thesaurus model for efficient search and indexing. The texture features are calculated using Gabor filters and a neural network algorithm is used to learn visual similarities. The system also incorporates a hierarchical vector quantization scheme to create a texture image thesaurus, making the indexing process more efficient. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in searching and selecting various geographic features from a large collection of airphotos. 
412404	41240451	Asking for more than an answer	The study discussed in this article focuses on the situational context that affects the quality of answers in online Q&A services. The researchers used a mixed method analysis to investigate this issue and found that users have three primary expectations when asking a question: quick responses, additional or alternative information, and accurate or complete information. By understanding these expectations, it may be possible to develop personalized approaches to improve information relevance and satisfaction for users of online Q&A services. This research addresses a gap in the current research on online Q&A and sheds light on how users engage in information seeking within this context. 
412404	4124049	User motivations for asking questions in online Q&A services	The study aims to understand what motivates individuals to ask questions in online Q&A services. Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were used as test beds, and a mixed method approach was utilized, including a survey, diary method, and interviews. The results showed that cognitive needs were the main motivation for asking a question, but other factors such as tension-free needs also played a role depending on the user's context. Understanding these motivations can help improve question-answering processes and provide a framework for understanding information needs in online Q&A. This study has broader implications for understanding online information-seeking behaviors.
412404	4124045	The blind leading the blind: Impromptu leaderships influenced by awareness in collaborative search.	This paper explores the impact of different leadership styles on online collaboration, a necessary method in today's work environments. The study involves 84 participants in 42 pairs, working in three different conditions that vary in the level of awareness provided to team members. The results show that teams with higher awareness of their personal and team progress exhibit less leadership and more democratic behavior, leading to more diverse information exploration and less need for communication. This research provides valuable insights into the relationship between leadership styles, team awareness, and information exploration in online collaboration. It is the first attempt to explore these connections and offers practical implications for effective collaboration.
412405	41240565	Barriers to organizing information during cancer care: &quot;I don't know how people do it.&quot;.	Patients are receiving a large amount of health information and are expected to take an active role in managing it. However, both patients and clinicians are frustrated with the lack of effective organization and use of this information. A study was conducted on cancer patients to identify barriers they face in organizing their health information. Four types of barriers were found: emotional, scalable, temporal, and functional. Suggestions are provided for reducing these barriers through technology or social changes. This study offers guidance for health-information providers, technology designers, and patients and their caregivers.
412405	4124050	Locating Patient Expertise in Everyday Life.	When individuals face new health issues, they often need to learn how to manage their personal health. Some patients turn to other patients for advice and support, using internet-based social software to connect with others who have similar experiences. However, these platforms often lack effective ways for users to find sources of expertise. This study looked at how patients with breast cancer locate expertise and found similarities with professionals in workplace organizations. However, patients also use unique strategies, such as seeking unsolicited advice and using triangulation, due to the high stakes of their health problems. The study suggests five ways that social software could be improved to better support patients in finding expertise from other patients.
412405	41240538	Health vlogger-viewer interaction in chronic illness management	Health vlogs are online videos created by individuals with chronic illnesses to share their experiences and knowledge with the general public. These vlogs help to create a connection between the vlogger and their viewers. A recent qualitative study looked at the different ways health vloggers establish this connection. The study found that vloggers use different genres to convey specific messages, and the video medium allows for a deeper connection with viewers. The vloggers also actively seek interaction with their audience. Based on these findings, design strategies are suggested to facilitate and build sustainable communities for health vloggers. 
412406	41240638	Fixed-Points of Social Choice: An Axiomatic Approach to Network Communities.	This article introduces a social choice theory approach to defining communities within social networks. The authors use a preference network framework in which members rank each other based on their preferences. They develop two approaches to studying communities: one indirectly through preference aggregation functions and the other directly through community axioms. These approaches reveal that community rules form a bounded lattice and have a structural characterization. However, defining community rules based solely on preference aggregation can lead to violations of desirable community axioms. The authors also provide a polynomial-time rule that satisfies seven axioms and weakly satisfies the eighth.
412406	41240610	Finding endogenously formed communities	The problem of determining overlapping communities in data mining and social network analysis without external identification is addressed using a framework based on the relative affinities among members. This framework, called an affinity system, defines communities as groups of members who prefer each other over anyone outside the group. A polynomial bound is provided for the number of self-determined communities and a polynomial-time algorithm is presented for enumerating them. This framework is particularly well-suited for social networks and interactions. The analysis is also connected to (α, β)-clusters and a polynomial bound is shown to exist while a superpolynomial number of clusters can exist in certain networks.
412406	41240635	The Hitchhiker's Guide to Affiliation Networks: A Game-Theoretic Approach	The proposed model for network formation focuses on the exertion of social effort rather than direct edge choices. This leads to a more natural explanation for the emergence of complex social structures. The model involves a game where players organize networking events at a cost that increases with the number of attendees. The benefit is shared equally among all attendees, resulting in a social network where links are formed between players who attend events together frequently. By analyzing Nash equilibria in this game, it is shown that for certain parameter values, the resulting social network is a complete graph, while for others, it exhibits substantial clustering and can produce any given degree sequence. This model offers an explanation for the observed structural properties of social networks, such as triadic closure, that were previously difficult to capture in existing models.
412407	4124078	Left and right convergence of graphs with bounded degree	The theory of convergent graph sequences has been studied in two different cases, dense graphs and bounded degree graphs. Convergence can be defined in terms of counting homomorphisms from fixed graphs into members of the sequence (left-convergence) or counting homomorphisms into fixed graphs (right-convergence). In the dense case, it has been shown that left-convergence and right-convergence are equivalent under certain conditions. This paper establishes a similar equivalence in the bounded degree case, with restrictions on the set of graphs in the right-convergence definition. This implies that for a left-convergent sequence, partition functions of a wide range of statistical physics models will converge. The proof utilizes techniques from statistical physics such as cluster expansion and Dobrushin Uniqueness. This work was supported by OTKA (67867) and ERC (227701).
412407	4124075	Convergent sequences of sparse graphs: A large deviations approach	Sparse graphs are important models in various fields, such as combinatorics, probability theory, optimization, and statistical physics. These models are based on different notions of similarity and convergence, such as Benjamini-Schramm convergence, left-convergence, right-convergence, and partition convergence. However, the relationships between these notions are not well understood. In this paper, a new notion of convergence called Large Deviations (LD) convergence is introduced, which is based on the theory of large deviations. This is done by assigning random weights to the nodes of the graph and constructing corresponding random measures. LD-convergence implies the other three notions of convergence and also reveals new relationships between them. This can be used to express limiting free energies and understand the behavior of sparse graph sequences. 
412407	41240720	Fast convergence of natural bargaining dynamics in exchange networks	Bargaining networks involve a group of players trying to make agreements for profit, with Nash bargaining solutions being stable and balanced solutions. Kleinberg and Tardos proved that these solutions can be calculated in polynomial time. This paper answers the question of whether there are dynamics that can describe the bargaining process of real-world players and quickly reach a Nash bargaining solution. The paper introduces a single-stage local dynamics that models actual players' behavior and shows that fixed points of this dynamics correspond to Nash bargaining solutions. It also proves that the dynamics converge to an approximate solution in a polynomial time independent of the network size. The paper introduces a new technique from functional analysis that can be applied to similar problems and also demonstrates convergence to an approximate solution in polynomial time for bipartite graphs.
412408	41240821	Building member attachment in online communities: applying theories of group identity and interpersonal bonds	This article discusses the importance of online communities for organizations and the general public, and the lack of research on what makes some communities more successful than others. The authors applied theory from social psychology to understand how online communities develop member attachment, a key factor in community success. They tested two sets of community features aimed at strengthening either group identity or interpersonal bonds, and found that both sets of features increased participants' visit frequency and self-reported attachment. However, features intended for identity-based attachment had a greater impact, particularly for newcomers. This research highlights the potential for applying social science theories to improve the success of online communities.
412408	41240865	The effects of diversity on group productivity and member withdrawal in online volunteer groups	The "wisdom of crowds" idea highlights the value of diversity in online collaborations like open source projects and Wikipedia. However, research on diversity in offline work groups has shown mixed results. While a diverse group can bring in a range of perspectives and improve outcomes, individual differences can also lead to conflicts and reduced performance. This paper examines the impact of diversity on group productivity and member withdrawal in WikiProjects. The study finds that diversity in experience with Wikipedia can increase productivity and decrease member withdrawal up to a certain point, beyond which members are more likely to withdraw. Interestingly, differences in member interest have a linear relationship with productivity and withdrawal. The study suggests that the low visibility of individual differences in online groups can allow them to reap the benefits of diversity while avoiding the drawbacks. These findings can inform future research on online collaborations.
412408	41240815	Motivating participation by displaying the value of contribution	Designers of online communities face a key challenge in motivating members to make meaningful contributions. This can be due to members struggling to find opportunities to contribute or not understanding the value of their contributions. To address this, social science theories suggest that providing different perspectives on the value of contributions can increase participation. This study examines a new design feature for an existing community website that offers personalized contribution opportunities and estimates the value of each contribution. The value is calculated in four ways: to the individual, a small group they identify with, a small group they don't identify with, and the entire community. The study compares the effectiveness of these different value perspectives on 160 community members.
412409	41240910	Compilation for explicitly managed memory hierarchies	A new compiler has been developed for machines with a managed memory hierarchy.

412409	41240942	Scatter-add in data parallel architectures	Data parallelism is a common feature in many important applications, and computer systems are designed to take advantage of it. However, some operations in multimedia and scientific applications can slow down the process due to serialization. To address this issue, a new mechanism called scatter-add is introduced, which is a data-parallel version of the scalar fetch-and-op. This mechanism allows for efficient support of data-parallel atomic update computations and can be applied to both single and multi-processor systems. The micro-architecture of scatter-add on a stream architecture shows promising results with minimal increase in die area and significant performance speedups on a variety of applications.
412409	41240950	A distributed multi-GPU system for fast graph processing	Lux is a distributed multi-GPU system designed for fast graph processing. It utilizes the memory bandwidth of multiple GPUs and takes advantage of locality in the memory hierarchy of multi-GPU clusters. Lux offers two execution models that optimize algorithm efficiency and enable important GPU optimizations. It also uses a dynamic load balancing strategy for better distribution of workload across GPUs. A performance model is also presented, which predicts execution times and automatically selects runtime configurations for Lux applications. Experiments show that Lux outperforms shared memory systems by 20 times and distributed systems by up to two orders of magnitude in terms of speed.
412410	4124106	Policy auditing over incomplete logs: theory, implementation and applications	This article presents an algorithm, called reduce, that checks audit logs for compliance with privacy and security policies. The algorithm addresses two main challenges in compliance checking: realistic policy applicability and incomplete audit logs. Reduce operates on policies expressed in a first-order logic that allows restricted quantification and uses logic programming to identify the restricted form of quantified formulas. It can handle all 84 disclosure-related clauses of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The algorithm proceeds iteratively and outputs a residual policy that can only be checked with additional information. The article proves correctness, termination, time and space complexity results for reduce and provides an optimized implementation using two heuristics for database indexing. Experimental results show that the algorithm is fast enough for practical use.
412410	41241042	Constraining Credential Usage in Logic-Based Access Control	Authorization logics are used to create access-control policies in logic-based systems. Resource owners issue credentials that specify these policies, and logical inference rules are used to determine the consequences of these policies. Proofs in authorization logics can serve as capabilities for accessing resources. However, since proofs can be derived from multiple credentials, the issuer of a specific credential may not be aware of all the possible consequences of their policy. To address this issue, a system is proposed where credentials can specify constraints on their usage. These constraints can be expressed as functions over authorization proofs, allowing for a wide range of constraints. The formal properties and examples of such constraints are studied.
412410	4124105	A Logical Method for Policy Enforcement over Evolving Audit Logs	The article discusses an iterative algorithm designed to enforce policies represented in first-order logic, specifically those related to transmission in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The logic used poses challenges due to its use of uninterpreted predicates, real-time temporal properties, and quantification over infinite domains. The algorithm operates on incomplete and evolving audit logs and checks as much of the policy as possible in each iteration. The remaining policy is then checked when the log is updated with new information. The algorithm's correctness and termination properties are proven, and it is shown to effectively enforce safety and co-safety properties. The algorithm has potential to help with automated enforcement of HIPAA Privacy Rule policies. 
412411	4124112	Digestor: device-independent access to the World Wide Web	Digestor is a software system that allows for easy access to the World-Wide Web on small screen devices such as PDAs and cellular phones. It works by automatically reformatting web pages to fit the screen size of the device, using a planning algorithm and structural page transformations. This means that users can view web pages on their small screen devices without having to zoom in or scroll. Digestor is implemented as an HTTP proxy, making it a convenient and efficient solution for device-independent web browsing on the go.
412411	41241164	IntelliPrompter: speech-based dynamic note display interface for oral presentations.	Many presenters struggle with the fear of forgetting what to say next during oral presentations. To combat this, they often use written notes alongside presentation slides. However, this can lead to disengagement and low-quality presentations. To address this issue, the researchers developed IntelliPrompter, a speech-based note display system that tracks the presenter's coverage of each slide and dynamically adjusts the note display to highlight the most relevant topic. Two versions of the system were created using Google Glass and computer screens, based on feedback from 36 interviews and analysis of presentation notes. In a study comparing the dynamic screen-based and Google Glass interfaces with a static note system, the dynamic option was preferred by presenters and independent judges.
412411	41241126	Quester: A Speech-Based Question Answering Support System for Oral Presentations.	Quester is an intelligent system that provides fast access to relevant presentation slides during question answering sessions and supports nonlinear presentations. It uses semantic closeness to rank slides and display the most related ones, highlighting relevant keywords in slide notes. The design was informed by expert presenters and recordings of lectures and presentations. In a study, presenters preferred Quester over a static slide navigation system, finding it more efficient and allowing for more flexibility in sequencing their presentations. This system addresses the limitations of current slideware, which mainly supports linear oral presentations, and aims to enhance the delivery of more dynamic and extemporaneous presentations. 
412412	41241242	"…is it normal to be this sore?":: using an online forum to investigate barriers to physical activity	Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining overall health, but many adults in the U.S. lead sedentary lifestyles. Lowering perceived barriers to physical activity is an important part of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. Through a systematic qualitative coding of an online forum used in a three-month healthy lifestyle intervention, the top five barriers to physical activity were identified. Two of these barriers have not previously been reported in the literature. This paper provides design considerations for technologies that can support and encourage physical activity, based on the identified barriers. Understanding the needs of a population is essential in designing effective interventions, and this paper offers valuable insights for those working in this field.

412412	41241236	Theory-driven design strategies for technologies that support behavior change in everyday life	This paper introduces design strategies for persuasive technologies aimed at helping individuals modify their daily behaviors. These strategies build upon existing design goals and incorporate social factors and tactics to effectively target long-term discretionary use in everyday life. The researchers applied these strategies to create a system that promotes physical activity and conducted two field studies, a three-week trial and a three-month experiment, which demonstrated the system's success in encouraging individuals to lead a more active lifestyle. These findings support the effectiveness of the proposed design strategies for persuasive technologies in facilitating behavior change.
412413	4124130	UWB-Based Tracking of Autonomous Vehicles with Multiple Receivers.	This paper discusses real-time tracking of an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) in an indoor industrial setting. The AGV's on-board odometer provides information about its position and orientation, while an external Ultra Wide Band (UWB) wireless network compensates for any error drift. Two new solutions for real-time tracking are proposed: a classical Time Differences of Arrivals (TDOA) approach with a single receiver, and a "Twin-receiver" TDOA (TTDOA) approach that requires two independent receivers on the AGV. The effectiveness of these algorithms is evaluated in realistic conditions, showcasing the tradeoff between the frequency and quality of UWB measurements.
412413	41241339	Improved ultra wideband-based tracking of twin-receiver automated guided vehicles	This paper discusses a new system for tracking Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in indoor industrial settings. The system combines an on-board odometer and an external Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) wireless network to accurately predict the AGV's position and orientation. Two tracking solutions are proposed: one using a single receiver and the other using two receivers on the AGV. The latter allows for increased accuracy and can still estimate the AGV's movement even when the odometer fails. The system's performance is evaluated in realistic conditions, showing that it can achieve sub-centimeter accuracy with low-complexity UWB receivers and commercial odometers. This system has potential applications in warehouse automation.
412413	41241381	Structured transition systems with parametric observations: observational congruences and minimal realizations	There are many different ways to describe processes using observational semantics, often using the concept of bisimulation. This paper discusses the possibility of creating a common framework for these semantics, using algebraic methods. The authors introduce a class of algebras called Structured Transition Systems, which represent both states and transitions in a process. This framework allows for various types of observations to be represented by mappings and algebraic structures. The authors also propose a parameterized notion of bisimulation, which depends on the choice of observation algebra. They provide constraints for these presentations to ensure that the bisimulation is always a congruence, and address the problem of finding minimal realizations of these presentations. Ultimately, this framework allows for a unified approach to describing different observational semantics in process description languages.
412414	4124147	Natural language analysis for semantic document modeling	This paper discusses a method for organizing and retrieving web documents through semantic document classification. This approach uses a combination of linguistic tools and a conceptual domain model to create a controlled vocabulary for a document collection. Users can browse the model and select relevant fragments to classify documents. Natural language tools are then used to analyze the text and suggest model fragments based on the selected concepts and relations. These fragments are refined by users and stored in RDF-XML format for retrieval. A prototype of the system is presented, with examples from a medical document collection. Lexical analysis is also used to refine search queries using the domain model.
412414	41241439	Semantically Accessing Documents Using Conceptual Model Descriptions	This paper discusses a method for classifying and retrieving documents on the Web using Natural Language Processing and Conceptual Modeling. The approach involves using a controlled vocabulary to classify documents, which is created using a combination of a lexical analysis tool and the Referent Model language. Documents are classified by identifying high frequency words in the document that also appear in the domain model defining the vocabulary. These sentences are then parsed and stored using RDF-XML syntax, creating a connection between the document and the domain model. This approach is currently being implemented for a document collection published by the Norwegian Center for Medical Informatics (KITH).
412414	41241455	A Flexible Workbench for Document Analysis and Text Mining	Document analysis and text mining techniques play a crucial role in information retrieval systems, ontology construction processes, and knowledge discovery and classification. However, configuring and combining these techniques can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, a workbench has been developed that allows for easy integration of new techniques and experimentation with different combinations. This paper discusses the architecture of the workbench and demonstrates its use in extracting ontological concepts and relationships from a document collection published by the Norwegian Center for Medical Informatics. This workbench provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of document analysis and text mining.
412415	41241525	Characterizing network events and their impact on routing	Network events, also known as incidents, are disruptions to the usual functioning of elements in an IP network. These elements, such as routers, network interface cards, and IP links, can fail or malfunction due to various reasons. For instance, a router may need to be rebooted for a software upgrade, an interface card may crash, or an IP link may become overloaded due to a denial-of-service attack. These incidents can affect the traffic of customers, resulting in packet loss, delays, or even complete loss of connectivity to parts of the network. To address these issues, network operators must diagnose the problem and find a solution. The study of network events, their causes, and their impact was conducted using data from a large European provider's Virtual Private Network (VPN) backbone, which connects over ten thousand enterprise networks but does not connect to the internet.
412415	41241534	Joint analysis of network incidents and intradomain routing changes	 causes of these changes, a joint analysis of routing and trouble tickets is performed.The paper analyzes the relationship between intradomain routing instability and network trouble tickets in two different networks: a VPN provider and the Internet2 backbone network. The goal is to better understand the underlying causes of routing instability. A method is developed to correlate trouble tickets with instability events and it is found that there is no single cause for most instability and that the causes differ across networks. The study also compares results to a previous study, finding that certain causes of instability have become less prevalent while others, such as software-related problems, have become more common. The paper highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the causes of network incidents and the potential for joint analysis of routing and trouble tickets in identifying these causes.
412415	41241536	On the Reliability of Profile Matching Across Large Online Social Networks	The ability to match user profiles across multiple social networks has the potential to provide new services and insights, but also raises privacy concerns. Previous studies have shown that accurate profile matching is possible, but only on small datasets. This paper examines the reliability of profile matching in real-world scenarios, using publicly available information. The authors propose a set of properties, called ACID, that are necessary and sufficient to determine the accuracy of a matching scheme. Their evaluation method shows that the accuracy of profile matching in practice is significantly lower than in previous studies, due to the large number of users and similar profile attributes. This paper highlights the challenges of profile matching in the real world and offers a proper methodology for evaluating its accuracy.
412416	41241637	Instant Places: Using Bluetooth for Situated Interaction in Public Displays	Instant Places is a study that explores the use of Bluetooth presence and naming as tools for interactive experiences around public displays. The authors not only use Bluetooth names for identity representation, but also as a means of triggering content on situated displays. Through deploying a prototype in a bar for several weeks, the study examines the effectiveness of these techniques and the resulting social practices. The findings suggest that the simplicity of these techniques does not hinder their ability to sustain interaction and can be easily adapted for new forms of social engagement. 
412416	41241643	Steerable augmented reality with the beamatron	Steerable displays are advanced systems that use a motorized platform and a camera to project graphics at any point in a room. This allows for the superimposition of graphics onto the real world, making them useful for augmented reality and ubiquitous computing scenarios. The Beamatron is a new type of steerable display that incorporates a computer-controlled pan and tilt platform, a projector, and a Kinect sensor. Unlike previous versions, the Beamatron uses live depth data to enable reasoning in 3D, allowing for more dynamic and interactive graphics. Two example applications of the Beamatron include an augmented reality game where a player can control a virtual car in a real room, and a demo that uses speech and gesture to move projected graphics around the room. 
412416	41241678	Citywide: Supporting Interactive Digital Experiences Across Physical Space	The Citywide project aims to use technology to enhance people's experiences while moving through physical space. This includes historical experiences, performances, and games. Two prototype demonstrators have been created to showcase the potential of this project. The first involves a search party exploring an archaeological site and uncovering virtual scenes relevant to their location. The second is a museum experience where participants hunt for virtual artifacts in an outdoor location and then study them in the museum. Different devices, such as mobile wireless interfaces, are used to create unique experiences based on location and task. The use of a shared virtual world allows for interactive experiences across different physical settings.
412417	4124175	Information Holodeck: Thinking In Technology Ecologies	This paper discusses the potential for technology to support human thinking, learning, and sensemaking through device ecosystems (DDEs). The authors propose a theoretical framework that incorporates digital information into Vygotsky's sign mediation triangle, introducing the concept of objectification where perceivable objects can be associated with signs to aid in thinking. A qualitative study with graduate students was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of DDEs in supporting objectification. The findings suggest that DDE technologies can afford objectification in two distinct ways. This work advances a method for examining device ecologies in terms of their potential for learning and offers insights for designing technology that can enhance higher thought processes.
412417	41241723	The effects of visual contextual structures on children's imagination in story authoring interfaces	This paper examines how the use of contextual visual images can influence a child's imagination when creating digital content using authoring systems. The focus is on children aged 8 to 10, as this is a critical period where creativity can decrease. A study was conducted where children used a storytelling system with either a contextual background image or a blank screen. Through video coding and analysis, differences were found in the storytelling process and product between the two conditions. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the design of authoring systems for children.
412417	41241748	Multimodal human discourse: gesture and speech	Gesture and speech play a crucial role in human communication. To incorporate them into human-computer interaction (HCI), it is important to understand how they work together. A framework has been proposed to understand the relationship between gesture and speech. The researchers have also studied the use of cross-modal cues in gesticulation during natural conversation as a new approach to multimodal interaction. This is based on the idea that gestures and speech are generated from the same intent. A case study was conducted where a subject described their living space to an interlocutor. The video and audio data were analyzed to identify cues that match with the expert psycholinguistic analysis. It was found that the use of handedness and symmetry in gestures can be effective in understanding the overall discourse structure. 
412418	41241825	IDSET: Interactive Design System using Evolutionary Techniques	The paper proposes a system called IDSET, which supports the creation of tools using evolutionary techniques. The system has two stages - one where fundamental shapes are generated and another where they are combined. The system generates new shapes at each stage and displays them to the user, stimulating their creativity. Unlike other systems, IDSET starts with creating parts instead of using pre-prepared parts, resulting in a variety of novel tools. The user only needs to evaluate the displayed tools, rather than creating them. The system was tested through computer experiments, and various tools and artistic shapes were successfully created, some of which were not easily imaginable by humans. This demonstrates the effectiveness of IDSET.

The network is able to build relationships between sentences about similar things, and has been shown to outperform other networks without labels or synonym sets. It is also able to handle noise, answer factoid questions, and solve single-choice questions for non-native English learners.
412419	41241956	Experimental Evaluation of Ontology-Based Test Generation for Multi-agent Systems	Software agents are becoming increasingly popular for managing complex, distributed systems. To ensure the reliability of these systems, there is a growing need for methodologies and techniques that can effectively test multi-agent systems. A new approach, using an agent interaction ontology, has been developed and incorporated into a testing framework called eCAT. This framework can automatically generate and evolve test cases, and continuously run them. In this paper, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of this ontology-based approach through experiments using two BDI agent applications. The results demonstrate the framework's performance and its ability to identify faults in the tested systems.
412419	41241926	Evolutionary testing of autonomous software agents	Testing autonomous software agents is crucial for ensuring their correctness, as they make independent decisions that can have significant consequences. However, testing these agents can be challenging due to their ability to react differently to the same inputs over time. To address this problem, the authors propose an approach that uses evolutionary optimization to generate demanding test cases. This approach involves deriving fitness functions and evaluating them with simulated agents. The results show that this method is effective in automatically finding good test cases, making it a valuable tool for testing autonomous agents. 
412419	41241941	Evolving requirements in socio-technical systems: concepts and practice	Changes in requirements are common in sociotechnical systems that involve human organizations, individuals, and software systems. These changes can occur due to various reasons, such as software components not functioning as expected or changes in organization rules, laws, and resources. This creates a need for continuous analysis of evolving requirements in a traceable manner. The authors were inspired by their experience in a health-care project and analysis practices using participatory design methods and law-compliant requirements analysis techniques. They propose a new framework that facilitates an evolutionary and participatory process for requirements evolution in sociotechnical systems. This framework includes concepts and practices to support the continuous analysis of evolving requirements in a traceable way.

412420	41242049	Knowledge Representation And Reasoning In Software Engineering	The special issue focuses on using knowledge and specific principles to solve complex problems with computers, rather than relying on general principles. It explores how this approach has influenced research on tools for enhancing software productivity and quality. The idea for the issue stemmed from a workshop on intelligent and cooperative information systems, which took place in April 1991. The workshop discussed various tools and issues related to them, and the special issue aims to further explore these topics. 
412420	41242047	Goal-Oriented Conceptual Database Design	The paper discusses a goal-oriented process for database requirements analysis, which involves multiple steps from high-level goal analysis to detailed conceptual schema design. This approach uses goal modeling to systematically analyze the application domain and specify database requirements. A goal-oriented design strategy is proposed to guide the transformation from the domain model to the conceptual schema based on user-defined design issues. This process is demonstrated through a real-world example from the design of a biological database. The paper also introduces a prototype tool that stores design sessions in a queryable form, allowing for more comprehensive and detailed analysis compared to traditional database design methodologies.
412421	41242195	Optimally fast parallel algorithms for preprocessing and pattern matching in one and two dimensions	This article discusses optimal parallel algorithms for string matching problems, specifically in one dimension. The authors have designed an algorithm that can efficiently compute a substring in constant time, which was previously a bottleneck in pattern preprocessing. They have also improved the preprocessing time for constant-time text search and developed algorithms for deterministic and probabilistic string matching in certain cases. Additionally, the article presents a constant expected time Las-Vegas algorithm for string matching, solving a major issue in this field.
412421	412421160	Overcoming the Memory Bottleneck in Suffix Tree Construction	The suffix tree is a crucial data structure for processing strings and has become more relevant with the rise of massive data sets. However, existing algorithms for building and using suffix trees are hindered by memory limitations. The authors propose a new algorithm that optimizes disk accesses by utilizing sort and scan primitives. This algorithm performs well in both sequential and parallel computational models, achieving optimality in terms of disk accesses. Additionally, the algorithm takes into account the difference between random page accesses and block transfers, resulting in improved performance. This approach is shown to have the same optimal tradeoff as sorting.
412421	412421159	Budget optimization for online campaigns with positive carryover effects	Proper allocation of marketing budget for online advertising campaigns is a major challenge for marketers due to the large number of variables and decisions involved. In this paper, a Markov model of user behavior is used to study the interactions among these decisions. The budget allocation task is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem and solved using a simple LP algorithm. The results show that a greedy algorithm can also be used for budget allocation and performs well in terms of revenue compared to the optimal solution. Real-world data from sponsored search campaigns is used to evaluate the algorithm and it shows a consistent 5-10% improvement in revenue compared to a baseline algorithm that ignores carryover effects.
412422	41242264	Building and Testing a Statistical Shape Model of the Human Ear Canal	The current design of custom in-the-ear hearing aids relies on individual experience and skills rather than a systematic understanding of the variation in ear canal shape. This paper presents a method for creating a detailed model of the human ear canal using laser scanned ear impressions and expert-placed anatomical landmarks. The model is used to analyze potential differences in ear canal size and shape between genders. By warping a template mesh onto the ear canal shapes in the training set and using the resulting vertices to create a 3D point distribution model, a more accurate and reliable means of designing custom hearing aids can be achieved. 
412422	41242256	Analysis of surfaces using constrained regression models.	This study examines the relationship between changes in the shape of the human ear caused by jaw movement and acoustical feedback (AF) in hearing aids. Data from 42 hearing aid users, in open and closed mouth positions, was collected and analyzed to identify regions of the outer ear that play a significant role in AF.

Logistic regression penalized with elastic net (EN) is also used to localize the regions of the ear that contribute most to AF. The results are visually interpreted for clinical implications.
412422	41242220	Estimation of Independent Non-Linear Deformation Modes for Analysis of Craniofacial Malformations in Crouzon Mice	Crouzon syndrome is a genetic disease that causes premature fusion of cranial sutures and synchondroses, resulting in craniosynostosis. A decade ago, the Crouzon gene was discovered, and recently the first mouse model of the syndrome was created. In a new study, Micro CT scans were used to compare the heads of normal mice and Crouzon mice. A statistical deformation model based on independent component analysis (ICA) was developed, which showed clear differences between the two groups. This is an improvement from previous models, as it allows for a better understanding of the specific deformations caused by the disease. The ICA also revealed a new finding of asymmetries in the heads of Crouzon mice, likely caused by asymmetric closure of craniofacial sutures. This study provides insight into the link between craniofacial malformations and sutures in Crouzon syndrome.
412423	41242396	Effective User Relevance Feedback for Image Retrieval with Image Signatures.	CBIR has become increasingly popular as a method for searching and retrieving digital images, due to the large number of images now available online. Relevance feedback (RF) is a technique used in search engines that involves gathering feedback from users about the relevance of search results, and using this information to improve future searches. This paper presents a new approach for using RF with signature based image retrieval, which involves the user in the process and allows them to refine their search queries. Empirical experiments have shown that this approach improves the performance of CBIR in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability. This is a significant contribution as it addresses the problem of effectively reformulating image queries, for which there is currently no effective solution.
412423	41242327	Protein database search using compressed k-mer vocabularies.	Efficient and accurate search in biological sequence databases is crucial due to the increasing amount of genomic data available for analysis. Various methods have been developed to speed up the search process, such as explicit pairwise alignments and alignment-free techniques. However, these methods sacrifice sensitivity for speed. Other strategies, like inverted indexing and hashing, can quickly retrieve similar sequences from the database, but their precision decreases as the level of similarity decreases. To address these issues, a new search algorithm has been developed that uses a compressed vocabulary of short sub-sequences (k-mers) from the database to map each sequence to a binary feature vector. This approach incorporates biologically relevant symbol substitutions and has been shown to have comparable or better accuracy than existing methods, while significantly reducing search time.
412423	41242323	Efficient top-k retrieval with signatures.	This paper introduces a new method for indexing and searching large binary signature collections, addressing the scalability issue in signature search. While signatures are efficient in measuring similarity in various applications, performing a complete search requires calculating Hamming distance for each signature in the collection, which becomes impractical for large collections. The proposed method balances memory usage and precision to significantly improve search speed for finding similar signatures in very large collections. Experimental results show that this approach can efficiently find the nearest signatures to a given search argument, with high speed and accuracy.
412424	41242472	Performance of a Policy-Based Management System in IPv6 Networks Using COPS-PR	The implementation of a centralized server is the most effective way to ensure the correct Quality of Service (QoS) in new generation core networks. These networks commonly use DiffServ due to its scalability, making it suitable for large networks. A Bandwidth Broker architecture is a policy-based management system designed to centrally manage DiffServ networks through admission control and policy delivery. This paper showcases the implementation of this architecture for managing QoS in DiffServ dual networks (IPv4/IPv6). Developed using JAVA and COPS-PR as an intra-domain communication protocol, the system allows administrators to configure policies based on SLA/SLS. The performance of the architecture was evaluated using a real IPv6 DiffServ testbed, and the results and conclusions are presented.
412424	41242435	Characterizing fault propagation in safety-critical processor designs	The safety-critical systems industry is facing difficulties in achieving reduced time-to-market for electronic designs due to the certification process, which adds extra time and resources to the verification and validation process. To address this challenge, there is a demand for new tools and methods that can efficiently and cost-effectively verify robustness. While microarchitectural simulators have been used in various domains for reliability testing, their effectiveness in robustness verification is yet to be validated compared to traditional methods like RTL or gate-level simulation. This paper explores the use of fault injections in an RTL model of a processor to assess fault propagation. The results of this study will help determine the applicability of using microarchitectural simulators for robustness verification.
412424	41242431	Cohesion factors: improving the clustering capabilities of consensus	Corporate networks are facing increasing security concerns, making security tests crucial for identifying vulnerabilities. However, analyzing large amounts of complex data poses a challenge for experts. Unsupervised learning, specifically clustering, can aid in this process by grouping devices with similar vulnerabilities. To ensure the validity of results, an index must be calculated. Additionally, the number of clusters needs to be fine-tuned for each data set. This paper introduces the use of self-organizing maps (SOM) as a clustering method for evaluating complex and uncertain knowledge in Consensus, a distributed security system. New metrics, Intracohesion and Intercohesion factors, are proposed to assess cluster cohesion and cohesion between clusters. Unsupervised algorithms and validity metrics are applied to a security data set, and a method for determining the optimal number of clusters is presented based on these cohesion metrics.
412425	41242534	Evaluating and improving semistructured merge	This article compares unstructured and semistructured merge tools in terms of conflict detection and resolution. While previous studies have shown that semistructured merge tools result in fewer reported conflicts, it is unclear if this actually leads to increased productivity and quality. To address this, the authors reproduce over 30,000 merges from 50 open source projects and analyze the false positives and false negatives of each approach. Their findings show that semistructured merge tools have significantly fewer false positives and that these are easier to resolve, but there is no significant difference in false negatives. Based on these results, they develop an improved semistructured merge tool that reduces the number of reported conflicts, has no additional false positives, and has fewer false negatives compared to unstructured merge. 
412425	41242535	Understanding semi-structured merge conflict characteristics in open-source Java projects.	Merge conflicts are a common issue in software development, which can significantly affect developers' productivity. However, the underlying structure of these conflicts has not been studied before. In this paper, a catalog of conflict patterns is derived by analyzing the structure of code changes that lead to merge conflicts. The study focuses on conflicts reported by a semistructured merge tool, which avoids analyzing numerous spurious conflicts. An empirical study of 70,047 merges from 123 GitHub Java projects reveals that most conflicts occur when developers independently edit the same or consecutive lines of the same method. Additionally, conflicts often involve multiple developers and are caused by copying and pasting code across repositories. The study suggests the need for further research and improvements in collaborative software development tools.
412425	41242569	Using process simulation to assess the test design effort reduction of a model-based testing approach	Research is being conducted to address software development issues in the industry. However, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these solutions. Pilot studies are usually used, but it can be challenging to conduct them due to changes in the development process and limited resources. This study focuses on evaluating the benefits of using TaRGeT, a Model-Based Testing (MBT) tool, in reducing test design effort. Process simulation was used to demonstrate this reduction in a multi-site industry. Advantages of process simulation include lower costs and the ability to analyze multiple scenarios, but there are also limitations such as difficulty in creating accurate models and lack of support for simulation and comparison.
412426	41242681	On exploiting static and dynamically mined metadata for exploratory web searching	This paper discusses the limitations of current web search engines (WSEs) in meeting users' exploratory search needs, as they are designed for targeted, keyword-based searches. The authors propose a solution that incorporates both static and dynamically generated metadata to enhance the exploration aspect of web searching. This involves using online results clustering to provide users with an overview of top results, as well as utilizing various static metadata such as domain, language, date, and file type through a dynamic taxonomy and faceted exploration approach. Incremental algorithms are also designed to improve the speed of the exploration process. An experimental evaluation and user study show promising results in terms of effectiveness, flexibility, and user satisfaction. 
412426	41242615	Exploratory web searching with dynamic taxonomies and results clustering	This paper suggests using both explicit and mined metadata to enhance web searching with exploration services. Online results clustering can help users get an overview of the results and narrow down their focus. However, many WSEs only use advanced search options to utilize metadata such as domain, language, date, and filetype. To address this, the paper proposes a method that combines dynamic taxonomies and faceted exploration to make the most of both types of metadata. This approach aims to provide a more effective, flexible, and efficient exploration experience for users.
412426	41242612	Scalable entity-based summarization of web search results using MapReduce	Web search engines provide access to a vast amount of documents, but user queries usually only return a list of results. This can limit the exploration and analysis of the information. To improve this, structured and semantic data can be used to enrich the search results and allow for a more in-depth exploration. This is especially useful in professional searches like medical or patent searches. This paper discusses a method of providing these advanced exploration services without prior indexing of the documents. It uses the MapReduce distributed computation model on a Cloud infrastructure for efficient processing. The paper also includes an evaluation of platform configuration and tuning, which is important for optimal resource utilization. Experimental results show a significant speedup in various settings.
412427	41242739	Contextualization as an independent abstraction mechanism for conceptual modeling	The concept of context is relevant not only in computer science, but also in other fields. This paper proposes a framework for representing context in information modeling. Context is defined as a set of objects with names and possible references to other contexts. The framework allows for structuring context through traditional abstraction mechanisms such as classification, generalization, and attribution. The paper also explores the relationship between context and traditional abstraction mechanisms and presents a theory for contextualized information bases, including validity constraints, a model theory, and inference rules. The core theory can be expanded to support embedding of specific information models within the contextualization framework.
412427	41242719	Why-provenance information for RDF, rules, and negation	The origin of information on the Web is important for assessing its quality, trustworthiness, and understanding its context. Negative information is also important for reasoning, as long as it is associated with its source. This study focuses on collections of g-RDF ontologies, which consist of a g-RDF graph and a program with derivation rules. The goal is to determine the provenance of derived information, which is achieved by defining provenance stable models and using an algorithm based on Answer Set Programming. The results show that this approach accurately extends RDFS semantics and can handle various types of queries.
412427	41242742	Extended RDF as a semantic foundation of rule markup languages	The Semantic Web initiative relies on ontologies and automated reasoning to organize and process information. Rules can be added to ontologies to define new concepts based on existing ones. This includes the use of negative information to enable various forms of reasoning. In this paper, the authors propose an extension of RDF graphs with weak and strong negation, as well as derivation rules. Their framework, called Extended RDF, takes into account both truth and falsity extensions of properties and classes, allowing for truth value gaps. It also supports both closed-world and open-world reasoning by explicitly representing closed-world assumptions and ontological categories. 
412428	4124287	A New Lower Bound on the Number of Perfect Matchings in Cubic Graphs	The article discusses the number of perfect matchings in $n$-vertex cubic bridgeless graphs. It is proven that every such graph must have at least $n/2$ perfect matchings. A list of all 17 graphs with less than $n/2+2$ perfect matchings is provided. These results have implications in the study of perfect matchings and cubic graphs.
412428	41242867	Short Cycle Covers of Graphs with Minimum Degree Three	The Alon-Tarsi conjecture states that all edges in a bridgeless graph with $m$ edges can be covered by cycles with a total length of $7m/5$. However, we have proven that even smaller total lengths are possible for certain types of graphs. For example, cubic bridgeless graphs can be covered by cycles with a total length of $34m/21$, and bridgeless graphs with a minimum degree of three can be covered by cycles with a total length of $44m/27$. These results provide stronger bounds for the shortest cycle cover conjecture. 
412428	41242852	An improved linear bound on the number of perfect matchings in cubic graphs	The study proves that a cubic bridgeless graph with n vertices will have at least 3n/4-10 perfect matchings. This is significant because it is the first time a bound has been found that is more than a constant away from the maximum dimension of the perfect matching polytope. This finding provides new insight into the structure of cubic bridgeless graphs and their perfect matchings.
412429	4124293	Sliding Mode Congestion Control for data center Ethernet networks	Data centers are increasingly adopting Ethernet as the unified switch fabric, known as Data Center Ethernet. One important enhancement is the end-to-end congestion management, for which Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN) has been established as the standard. However, experiments have shown that QCN can experience queue oscillation at bottleneck links, resulting in decreased link utilization. This is due to the fact that QCN's equilibrium point is mainly reached through sliding mode motion, which is influenced by system parameters and network configurations. To address this issue, the Sliding Mode Congestion Control (SMCC) scheme has been proposed, which is simple, stable, and has a fast response time. SMCC can easily replace QCN and outperforms it in variable traffic and network conditions. Experiments on the NetFPGA platform have demonstrated the superiority of SMCC.
412429	412429113	Phase Plane Analysis of Quantized Congestion Notification for Data Center Ethernet	Ethernet is being improved to become the primary switch fabric in data centers, reducing costs and simplifying network design and management. One important enhancement is congestion management, with the recent ratification of Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN) as the formal standard. However, there has been a lack of in-depth theoretical analysis on QCN, possibly due to its heuristic design and variable structure. This paper uses the phase plane method to analyze the QCN system, presenting its dynamic behaviors and deducing sufficient conditions for stability. It is found that QCN's stable queue is mainly due to its sliding mode motion, which is confirmed by experiments on the NetFPGA platform. These analytical results can help guide proper parameter settings for QCN.
412429	412429157	Analysing convergence of Quantized Congestion Notification in Data Center Ethernet	The article discusses the use of Ethernet as a unified data center fabric to handle the traffic of LAN, SAN, and HPC. One important enhancement to bridge the performance gap between traditional Ethernet and the unified data center fabric is congestion management. Although Quantized Congestion Notification (QCN) has been adopted as the standard mechanism, it has been criticized for its unfairness among different flows. The paper presents a convergence time model to explain the slow convergence process of QCN and suggests that the convergence time can be reduced by adjusting QCN parameters or introducing a modified Timer mechanism called QCN-T. The model is validated through experiments on the NetFPGA platform, and the impact of various factors on convergence time is analyzed.
412430	41243071	The Effect of Information Utilization: Introducing a Novel Guiding Spark in the Fireworks Algorithm.	The fireworks algorithm (FWA) is a popular swarm intelligence algorithm used in various applications. A new feature called the guiding spark (GS) is introduced to enhance its performance by utilizing more information. This is achieved by constructing a guiding vector (GV) using the objective function's information from explosion sparks, and adding it to the position of the firework to generate an elite solution called a GS. The new version, called guided FWA (GFWA), shows improved performance in both exploration and exploitation compared to previous versions and other similar algorithms. The simplicity and effectiveness of the GS make it applicable to other population-based algorithms.
412430	41243064	Iterative improvement of the Multiplicative Update NMF algorithm using nature-inspired optimization.	Low-rank approximations of data, such as those based on the Singular Value Decomposition, have been widely used in various data mining applications. The Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a special type of low-rank approximation that enforces non-negativity constraints. The Multiplicative Update (MU) algorithm, one of the original NMF algorithms, is known for its fast iterations. However, it requires a large number of iterations to accurately approximate the original data. In this paper, a new iterative update strategy for the MU algorithm, inspired by nature-based optimization algorithms, is proposed to improve its accuracy and reduce runtime. The NMF objective function used in the MU algorithm is non-differentiable, discontinuous, and prone to local minima, making heuristic search algorithms a suitable choice. Experimental results show that the new strategy achieves the same accuracy as the standard MU algorithm with significantly fewer iterations and faster overall runtime.
412430	4124300	Swarm Intelligence For Non-Negative Matrix Factorization	The Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a method for representing data in a parts-based and interpretable way. This article discusses efforts to enhance NMF's convergence, approximation quality, and classification accuracy using five different swarm intelligence-based meta-heuristics. The non-convex and discontinuous nature of the NMF objective function makes it suitable for meta-heuristic optimization. The proposed strategies involve a new initialization method for NMF and an iterative update strategy for the multiplicative update algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, including spam filtering and email classification, show that these strategies significantly improve NMF in terms of speed, accuracy, and runtime. The initialization strategy, in particular, leads to significant reductions in runtime without compromising accuracy for both NMF approximation and classification results. 
412431	41243118	An implementation for small databases with high availability	This technique presents a method for implementing small databases in operating systems and distributed systems using the checkpointing mechanism. It combines elements of stable storage and master-slave approaches for fault tolerance and is well-suited for systems that use the processor pool paradigm. It has been successfully used to create a monitoring service for a distributed system, with the benefits of being simple, efficient, reliable, and available.
412431	41243131	Conditional Anonymous Authentication With Abuse-Resistant Tracing and Distributed Trust for Internet of Vehicles	The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a system designed to improve traffic management and road safety. Vehicles communicate with each other and with traffic management infrastructure through constant message broadcasting. It is crucial to protect the cybersecurity of the IoV system, as attacks on safety-related messages could be life-threatening. To balance the need for authenticity and privacy, researchers have proposed conditional anonymous authentication, where a trusted third party can reveal the identities of malicious vehicles. However, existing techniques assume a trusted tracer, which may not always be the case. To address this, a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with abuse-resistant tracing is proposed, which prevents a single tracer from revealing the identities of vehicles and distributes the tracing key to prevent any single authority from revealing identities.
412431	41243157	Timely Authentication in Distributed Systems	This paper explores the role of time in distributed authentication. The authors aim to justify the use of authentication protocols that rely on accurate timestamps and address concerns about the security of such protocols. They argue that, while there are potential vulnerabilities, it is possible to design a secure clock synchronization protocol as part of a larger effort towards building a secure distributed system. This paper serves as motivation for further research and development in this area.
412432	4124328	Non-redundant Multi-view Clustering via Orthogonalization	This paper proposes a new clustering paradigm for explorative data analysis that aims to find all non-redundant clustering views of the data. It acknowledges that in real-world applications, data can have multiple reasonable and interesting groupings from different perspectives, especially in high-dimensional data. The proposed framework includes two approaches: orthogonal clustering, which finds alternative clusterings by seeking orthogonality in the cluster space, and clustering in orthogonal subspaces, which seeks orthogonality in the feature space. The paper presents results from testing the framework on synthetic and high-dimensional data sets, demonstrating its ability to discover varied and meaningful solutions. This approach is referred to as multi-view clustering or non-redundant clustering, as it allows for different interpretations of the data without committing to a single clustering solution. 
412432	41243240	Iterative Discovery of Multiple AlternativeClustering Views	In data analysis, complex data can be interpreted in various ways. However, most clustering algorithms only provide one solution, leaving little room for exploration. To address this issue, a new approach has been introduced that allows the user to explore multiple clustering solutions for exploratory data analysis. This approach also considers the possibility that different clusterings may exist in different subspaces. An algorithm has been developed based on an optimization procedure that takes into account cluster quality and novelty. Experiments have shown that this method outperforms other alternatives and can be used for both simultaneous and iterative discovery of multiple clusterings.
412432	41243213	Multiple Clustering Views from Multiple Uncertain Experts.	Expert input is crucial in improving clustering performance, and in today's collaborative environment, crowdsourced multiple expert input is becoming more common. However, the existing approaches can only discover one clustering structure, while data is multi-faceted and can be clustered in different ways. In this paper, the problem of automatically discovering multiple ways to cluster data given diverse inputs from uncertain experts is addressed. A Bayesian probabilistic model is proposed to learn the multiple expert views and associated clustering structures. This approach has several benefits, including the discovery of diverse clustering structures and improving the quality of clustering solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other baselines.
412433	41243313	Automated cellular annotation for high-resolution images of adult Caenorhabditis elegans.	Recent advancements in high-resolution microscopy have opened up the possibility of studying gene expression at the individual cell level. The fixed lineage of cells in adult Caenorhabditis elegans makes it an ideal model for investigating complex biological processes such as development and aging. However, manually annotating individual cells in images of adult C. elegans is time-consuming and requires expertise. Automating this task is crucial for conducting high-resolution studies on a large scale. In this study, researchers developed an automated method for labeling a subset of 154 cells in high-resolution images of adult C. elegans. They used a combinatorial optimization approach and a learning algorithm to compare cells in test images with a manually annotated training atlas. The results showed an 84% median accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of automating cell annotation in adult C. elegans. 
412433	41243352	A principal skeleton algorithm for standardizing confocal images of fruit fly nervous systems.	The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a widely used model organism in biology. We are creating a 3D digital map of the fruit fly's larval nervous system by aligning high-resolution images of specific neurons using a method called principal skeleton alignment. This method involves identifying the principal skeleton of a larval image, which is a series of connected lines that represent the shape of the nervous system, and using it to align the images. The method has been successfully applied to both simulated and real images, including those of other patterns such as the adult fruit fly's ventral nerve cord and center brain. Supplemental materials and resources for this method can be found on our website.
412433	41243325	Rivulet: 3D Neuron Morphology Tracing with Iterative Back-Tracking.	The accurate reconstruction of single neurons from 3D confocal microscopic images is crucial for understanding their structure and function. However, automatic reconstruction is difficult due to varying image quality and the complexity of neuronal branching. To address these challenges, a new algorithm called Rivulet has been proposed. It uses a multi-stencil fast-marching and iterative back-tracking approach to trace neurons accurately, even in areas with high levels of noise. Evaluation of Rivulet with datasets from the Diadem challenge and BigNeuron project showed its robustness. The technical details of the algorithm and its comparison to other state-of-the-art methods are also discussed.
412434	41243455	Dividing Protein Interaction Networks by Growing Orthologous Articulations	The growing amount of data on protein-protein interaction networks has led to increased interest in comparing these networks across different species. To do this, researchers have proposed various models and algorithms for network alignment, which involves identifying conserved modules between networks. Traditionally, this involves creating a merged representation of the networks and using greedy techniques to find conserved modules. However, a new approach has been proposed that divides the networks into smaller subnets based on both graph theory and biological indicators, and then performs network alignment on these subnets. This approach has shown promising results in accurately identifying conserved modules and highlights the importance of considering orthology and articulation in comparative network analysis. 
412434	41243445	Dividing protein interaction networks for modular network comparative analysis	The growth of data on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has led to increased research on their comparative analysis. Recent studies have focused on network alignment, which involves comparing networks across species to identify conserved functional complexes. This paper presents an algorithm for dividing PPI networks into smaller sub-graphs that are likely to cover conserved complexes, allowing for modular network alignment. The algorithm combines a graph-theoretical property with a biological one to accurately identify orthology and articulation points. Experiments on various PPI networks show that this dividing algorithm effectively covers protein functional complexes and can enhance the performance of network alignment algorithms. The source code is available for academic use upon request.
412434	41243423	Robust community detection methods with resolution parameter for complex detection in protein protein interaction networks	The paper discusses the challenge of accurately identifying communities within real-world networks. It has been found that traditional methods, which use a clustering measure called modularity, have a bias towards larger communities and struggle to identify smaller ones. To address this issue, a parameter is incorporated into the method to control the size of the communities, making it a multi-resolution method. The paper compares the performance of two different objective functions with this parameter, modularity and a newer function called w-log-v, on protein-protein interaction networks. The results show that w-log-v outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm and performs well on both original and perturbed networks. 
412435	41243543	Object Reconstruction By Incorporating Geometric Constraints In Reverse Engineering	This paper presents a new method for reconstructing 3D geometric models of objects from range data. It focuses on improving the overall shape of the model by incorporating geometric constraints based on feature positions. The proposed framework allows for incremental addition and integration of constraints, resulting in a balance between minimizing shape fitting error and satisfying constraint tolerances. The paper introduces sets of constraints for planar and quadric surfaces, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through experiments on synthetic and real objects. This work has significant implications for reverse engineering and manufactured object modelling, where feature relationships are commonly present. 
412435	41243564	Shape Reconstruction Incorporating Multiple Nonlinear Geometric Constraints	The paper discusses the reconstruction of 3D geometric shapes using observed measurements and multiple nonlinear shape constraints. The proposed framework allows for the incorporation of constraints during the reconstruction process, balancing the accuracy of shape fitting with the tolerance of the constraints. The paper also presents specific constraints for objects with planar and quadric surfaces, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach through real-world applications. This is the first work to provide a comprehensive framework for integrating numerical geometric relationships in object modeling from range data. The technique has the potential to greatly impact reverse engineering and manufactured object modeling, particularly for objects with intended feature relationships.
412435	41243520	Consistent Semantic Annotation of Outdoor Datasets via 2D/3D Label Transfer.	The success of scene understanding methods using machine learning relies heavily on large, accurate datasets for training and evaluation. However, creating these datasets from real sensor data often requires extensive manual annotation, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, a framework is proposed for annotating scenes captured by moving cameras, using a combination of 3D models and user refinement. This approach significantly reduces annotation time and improves consistency, as demonstrated by its use in creating a labelled outdoor dataset. Overall, the proposed framework offers a more efficient way to annotate scenes for training and evaluating scene understanding methods.
412436	41243689	Probabilistic management of OCR data using an RDBMS	The digitization of scanned documents is changing the way enterprises manage data. To integrate this data with existing enterprise data, OCR software is often used to convert images to ASCII text and store it in a relational database. However, OCR software can produce errors, leading to failed queries. State-of-the-art OCR programs use probabilistic models to account for these errors, but these models are usually discarded once the data is stored in the database. This study proposes retaining these probabilistic models in the database, but this poses a challenge due to the large size of the data. To address this, a new approximation scheme called Staccato is proposed, allowing users to balance query performance and accuracy. This scheme is integrated with standard RDBMS text indexing. 
412436	41243642	MYSTIQ: a system for finding more answers by using probabilities	MystiQ is a system that uses probabilistic query semantics to find answers in large numbers of data sources with low quality. This is due to various reasons such as different representations of the same data item, imperfect schema alignments, contradictory information, and fuzzy matches. Despite these challenges, users may still want to ask complex queries using SQL constructs like joins, subqueries, and quantifiers. This is useful for tasks like querying scientific data sources or finding rare associations for law enforcement. However, applying standard query semantics to these types of queries would result in empty answers. 
412436	41243637	Queries and materialized views on probabilistic databases	This paper discusses recent developments in evaluating queries over probabilistic databases. It highlights two techniques that can significantly reduce the complexity of query evaluation: separating the query and the data, and using previously computed query results (materialized views). By separating the query and the data, the paper shows that some queries have a complexity that is #P-hard, while others have a complexity that is in PTIME. By rewriting a query in terms of views, its complexity can be reduced from #P-complete to PTIME. The paper also introduces the concept of a partial representation for views, which can be stored and used to answer subsequent queries on the probabilistic databases.
412437	41243760	Human and Machine Collaboration in Creative Design	The article discusses the idea of collaboration between humans and machines in the creative design process. It argues that machines cannot be creative in the same way as humans, but proposes a computational model that allows for collaboration between the two. The article then delves into the specific architectural challenges of such a system, emphasizing the complexity of design and the need for both human and machine contributions. It proposes an open and distributed architecture using software agents to facilitate collaboration and creativity. The article also addresses the roles of different agents and the challenges encountered in developing the system, including how to integrate human and machine contributions in the design process.
412437	4124371	Gesturing on the Steering Wheel: a User-elicited taxonomy	The principle of "Eyes on the road, hands on the wheel" is important when designing in-vehicle interfaces. Gesture interaction is a promising way to achieve this and improve safety. In a study, 40 participants were asked to elicit 6 gestures on the surface of the steering wheel, resulting in 240 gestures. A taxonomy of these gestures was created, providing valuable insights for designing in-vehicle gestural interfaces. This approach can help reduce driver distraction and ensure that drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. 
412437	4124377	Investigating and reflecting on the integration of automatic data analysis and visualization in knowledge discovery	This article discusses the integration of visualization and data mining for effective knowledge discovery, combining human and machine capabilities. The authors use a bottom-up bibliographic research approach to categorize techniques and identify current trends, gaps, and potential future directions for research. They examine the strengths and weaknesses of information visualization and data mining, as well as how researchers in each field use techniques from the other. The article proposes potential extensions based on patterns found in the literature and compares the discovery process from the perspectives of both information visualization and data mining. This leads to reflections and research questions that can contribute to the advancement of visual analytics.
412438	41243815	Glyph: Visualization Tool for Understanding Problem Solving Strategies in Puzzle Games.	Understanding player strategies is crucial for both academic researchers and industry practitioners when analyzing player behavior. For game designers and researchers, it is important to compare intended strategies with emergent strategies to identify glitches or undesirable behaviors. This is especially relevant in serious games used for education, as player strategies can indicate their cognitive progress towards learning goals. However, current methods for analyzing player strategies have limitations, such as difficulty in scaling up for large numbers of players and subjective biases. To address these issues, a new visualization technique has been proposed that allows for both an overview of strategies and examination of individual player behaviors. This approach has been tested on data from a commercial educational puzzle game and initial results show its effectiveness in understanding player strategies.
412438	41243848	Visual attention in 3D video games	The study of players' visual attention patterns in interactive 3D games is crucial for improving game design and graphics. To achieve fast rendering speed, graphics techniques often use perception-based rendering methods. By understanding players' visual attention patterns, game designers can enhance gameplay through adjustments in level design, textures, colors, and object placement. This paper addresses this issue by presenting results on visual attention patterns in two game types: action-adventure and first-person shooter. Analyzing visual attention in complex 3D game environments poses a challenge due to rapidly changing situations. The paper discusses a new approach to studying visual attention patterns in these environments.

However, there is limited research on how to effectively guide players through these complex worlds. This paper proposes a set of 21 navigational patterns, three level design choices, and eight game mechanics commonly used in 3-D action-adventure games, based on an analysis of 21 commercial titles. These design techniques can serve as a training tool for game designers and as a vocabulary for researchers studying navigation in 3-D games. This contribution aims to improve the overall navigational experience for players in high-budget games.

412439	41243954	Irish Treebanking and Parsing: A Preliminary Evaluation.	Language resources are crucial for linguistic research and the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, low-density languages like Irish have limited research in this area. This paper presents the first Irish dependency treebank and statistical dependency parser, which are important resources for Irish language development. The authors explain the methodology for creating the treebank and utilizing existing resources. They also discuss language-specific choices, such as prepositional attachment and clefting, and report an inter-annotator agreement of 0.7902 for a manually developed treebank. The authors also describe the initial parsing results achieved through MaltParser and propose a bootstrapping approach for further development. These new language resources will contribute to the advancement of Irish language research and NLP applications.
412439	41243913	Exploiting Visual Salience for the Generation of Referring Expressions	This paper introduces a new approach to generating referring expressions (GRE) that takes into account the visual context of the user. The approach combines a computational model of visual salience in 3-D environments with the Incremental Algorithm. This allows the GRE algorithm to dynamically compute the context set as the user navigates through a simulation. By integrating visual salience into the generation process, the algorithm can generate shorter and more detailed descriptions of the target object compared to other GRE algorithms. The paper also discusses the properties of visual perception, reviews previous work on visual salience and GRE, and presents a preliminary testing of the new algorithm. 
412440	41244026	Opinion Fluctuations and Disagreement in Social Networks	The article discusses a model of opinion dynamics that involves two types of agents: regular agents who update their beliefs based on information from their social neighbors, and stubborn agents who never change their opinions. In societies with both types of agents, there is no consensus among the regular agents and beliefs continue to fluctuate. The structure of the social network and the placement of stubborn agents influence the dynamics of opinions. The expected belief vector is shown to follow a differential equation and converge to a harmonic vector, while expected cross products of beliefs can be characterized through Markov chains. In large societies, a condition of homogeneous influence emerges, leading to similar distributions of beliefs among most regular agents.
412440	41244017	Constrained Consensus and Optimization in Multi-Agent Networks	The article discusses distributed algorithms that allow multiple agents to align their estimates with a particular value over a network with changing connectivity. This value can represent a consensus among agents or an optimal solution to an optimization problem. The focus is on constrained problems, where each agent's estimate is limited to a different constraint set. The authors present a "projected consensus algorithm" that combines local averaging with projection on individual constraint sets. The algorithm is a version of an alternating projection method with varying weights. Convergence and convergence rates are established. The authors also propose a "projected subgradient algorithm" for optimizing the sum of local objective functions subject to the intersection of constraint sets. This algorithm involves local averaging, taking subgradient steps, and projecting on constraint sets. Convergence to the same optimal solution is shown for certain cases.
412440	41244056	Optimal pricing in the presence of local network effects	The article explores the optimal pricing strategies of a monopolist selling a divisible good to consumers within a social network. The model considers the local network effect, where a consumer's usage is influenced by their neighbors' usage. The monopolist's pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to central agents in the network. The first part of the study examines individualized prices, where the optimal price for each consumer is proportional to their Bonacich centrality. The second part explores the optimal strategy for a single uniform price, and the third part looks at the problem of determining which consumers should receive a discount. An approximation algorithm is provided, guaranteeing at least 88% of the optimal profit if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price allocation.
412441	41244189	An Efficient Approach Toward the Asymptotic Analysis of Node-Based Recovery Algorithms in Compressed Sensing	The paper proposes a framework for analyzing node-based verification-based algorithms, where the signal length and number of non-zero elements scale with infinity. This framework is applied to study the performance of recovery algorithms in compressive sensing with random sparse matrices. It is found that there is a success threshold for the density ratio of the signal, below which the recovery algorithms are successful and above which they fail. This threshold depends on both the graph and the recovery algorithm. The results also show that there is a strong agreement between the asymptotic behavior and finite length simulations for large signal lengths. 
412441	41244151	A Hybrid Technique Using PCA and Wavelets in Network Traffic Anomaly Detection	Research into network anomaly detection has become increasingly important due to the rise in computer attacks. While there have been various approaches reported in the literature, they are often not freely available. However, the Kyoto2006+ dataset, a labeled network traffic flow dataset, is now publicly available. Most existing approaches for anomaly detection using this dataset rely on clustering techniques. This paper proposes a new approach, Hybrid PCA-Haar Wavelet Analysis, which combines two popular statistical and spectral analysis techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Haar Wavelet filtering. The paper presents experimental results using the Kyoto2006+ dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach compared to using the two techniques individually. 
412441	41244155	Studies in applying PCA and wavelet algorithms for network traffic anomaly detection	As network anomalies become more complex, there is a need for new techniques to detect them. Most current monitoring tools use a signature-based approach, but this needs to be combined with other methods for better coverage and speed. Researchers have been studying different techniques, such as PCA, clustering, and Wavelet-based spectral analysis, to detect network traffic anomalies. This paper has three main contributions: evaluating the effectiveness of PCA and Wavelet algorithms on a labeled data set, proposing a hybrid approach using PCA and Haar Wavelet analysis, and studying the impact of using only flow-based traffic summary data. The experimental results show that the hybrid approach is more accurate than using either algorithm alone.
412442	41244258	Comparison of LRD and SRD traffic models for the performance evaluation of finite buffer systems	The paper compares different traffic models to determine their ability to accurately represent real traffic in a single server queue with limited buffer space. Models with long range dependence (LRD), short range dependence (SRD), and a combination of both are evaluated. The results show that models such as circulant modulated Poisson processes and fractional autoregressive integrated moving average are effective in simulating heavy load conditions, but may not accurately represent traffic under low to medium load conditions. Additionally, the accuracy of the circulant modulated Poisson process model may be compromised when fitting actual traffic data.
412442	41244264	Analysis of f-ARIMA processes in the modelling of broadband traffic	The paper explores the use of fractional AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (f-ARIMA) processes for traffic modelling. These models are able to accurately capture both the long range dependence (LRD) and short range dependence (SRD) features of traffic. This allows for the creation of synthetic traffic traces with a controlled ratio of LRD and SRD components. The practical relevance of this feature is tested through discrete event simulations, specifically looking at queueing performance in various working conditions. The results show that a low-order f-ARIMA model with a strong "low frequency" SRD component can significantly improve queueing performance evaluation compared to a pure LRD model. However, the f-ARIMA model may not be suitable for more complex SRD components, as seen in the case of LAN traffic.
412442	41244252	On the Relevance of Correlation Dependencies in On/Off Characterization of Broadband Traffic	The paper discusses the joint measurements of IP and ATM traffic on a campus network, using ON/OFF modeling schemes to better understand heterogeneous aggregated traffics. The use of Paretogeometric distributions in these models results in a hyperbolic decay of the autocovariance function, indicating Long Range Dependence (LRD). The authors demonstrate that this modeling technique can accurately fit real traffic traces by examining the ON/OFF behavior of ATM traffic. They also find that the presence of correlation in the sequence of ON and OFF periods contributes to the observed LRD. To confirm this, different synthetic traces were analyzed using Wavelet analysis. Finally, the implications of these state correlations on queueing behavior were compared using discrete event simulations.
412443	41244310	How Does Software Process Improvement Address Global Software Engineering?	SPI programs have been used for decades to improve the quality and speed of software development. There are many different SPI approaches and a lot of experience available to guide and measure these projects. SPI covers a wide range of aspects from individual developer skills to entire organizations, including optimizing software lifecycle activities and creating organization awareness and project culture. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the topic of Global Software Engineering (GSE) in relation to SPI. A systematic mapping study was conducted and 30 papers were selected for an in-depth analysis. These papers discuss the use of cultural models and agile approaches in GSE, as well as identifying success factors and barriers for implementing SPI in a GSE context. 
412443	41244376	How do software developers experience team performance in lean and agile environments?	This paper explores the challenge of evaluating team performance in a constantly changing business environment. The objective is to understand how software developers experience performance in volatile circumstances and use this knowledge to guide the formation and maintenance of high-performing teams. The study used qualitative multiple-case interviews with 16 experienced practitioners from five organizations. The results revealed 33 major categories of performance factors, which were organized into a theoretical structure to explain how software teams perceive and evaluate their performance. The study concludes that integrating soft factors, such as communication, team spirit, and team identity, into the development process is crucial for enhancing performance experiences in a dynamic business environment.

Teaching distributed software development (DSD) through project courses where student teams are geographically dispersed has several advantages. It allows students to experience the challenges and strategies of working in a distributed team, preparing them for real-world software development. However, creating a sustainable environment for such courses is challenging.

412444	41244428	Assessing the usability of a visual tool for the definition of e-learning processes	The paper discusses a usability study of a visual language-based tool called ASCLO-S, which is used for creating adaptive e-learning processes. This tool utilizes flow diagrams to define different classes of learners and their suitable adaptive learning processes. The study uses a questionnaire-based survey and an empirical analysis to gather feedback from instructional designers. The results show that both the visual notation and the system prototype are user-friendly for designers with and without experience in computer usage and e-learning tools. The empirical analysis also reveals that the effort required to develop e-learning processes is not affected by the designer's experience, but rather by the complexity of the process. Overall, the tool is considered effective in assisting designers in creating adaptive e-learning processes.
412444	41244465	Class Point: An Approach for the Size Estimation of Object-Oriented Systems	This paper introduces Class Point, a new approach for estimating the size of object-oriented products. It presents two measures that have been theoretically validated and compared to other size measures. An initial empirical validation was also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures in predicting development effort for object-oriented systems. The results show that Class Point measures are useful and accurate in estimating the size of object-oriented products. The paper highlights the importance of accurate size measures in software development and the potential for Class Point to improve estimation accuracy.
412444	41244412	A User-Centered Methodology to Generate Visual Modeling Environments	Visual modeling environments are commonly used in CASE tools to support various activities in the software development process. These environments allow engineers to create models and views of software systems using visual languages. However, the effectiveness of these environments depends on the process and tools used to develop them. A user-centered methodology and a supporting tool are presented in this paper for the development of customized visual environments. This approach utilizes UML meta-modeling techniques and formal methods, and also incorporates incremental development and rapid prototyping through the use of an automatic generation tool. This allows designers to focus on the structural features of the target language without being burdened by the creation of the visual environment. 
412445	41244532	Weakly-private secret sharing schemes	Secret-sharing schemes are important in cryptography for creating secure protocols. However, the size of the shares in the best known schemes for general access structures is too large to be practical. The lower bound for sharing an l-bit secret with n parties is ω(ln/log n), but no progress has been made in closing this gap. To address this issue, researchers have investigated a weaker notion of privacy in secret-sharing schemes where unauthorized parties cannot rule out any secret, rather than not learning any probabilistic information. Surprisingly, they were able to construct schemes with smaller shares for various access structures, with the size becoming more efficient as the secret size grows. For example, for a specific access structure, they were able to construct a scheme with shares of size l + n log n, and for a 2-out-of-n threshold access structure, they were able to construct a scheme with 2-bit shares, compared to ω(log n) in perfect secret-sharing schemes.
412445	41244524	Separating the Power of Monotone Span Programs over Different Fields	Monotone span programs are a computational model that uses linear algebra operations to represent and evaluate functions. They are closely related to linear secret sharing schemes and have various applications in cryptography and complexity theory. One key question is how the choice of the field in which the algebraic operations are performed affects the power of the span program. This paper proves that monotone span programs over finite fields with different characteristics are incomparable, with a super-polynomial separation between any two fields. This also leads to a super-polynomial lower bound for monotone span programs for a function in uniform-NC2, solving an open problem. The paper also shows that quasi-linear schemes are more powerful than linear secret sharing schemes, providing evidence that non-linear secret sharing schemes are more efficient.
412445	41244548	Secret-sharing schemes: a survey	A secret-sharing scheme is a way for a dealer to distribute shares to certain parties so that only authorized groups can reconstruct the secret. These schemes have important applications in cryptography and are used in various secure protocols. The survey discusses different constructions of secret-sharing schemes, including their connections to monotone formulae and span programs. One main issue with existing schemes is their large share size, which is believed to be unavoidable. Lower bounds for share size have been proven, but there is still a significant gap between the lower and upper bounds. The article also covers results connecting these schemes to other problems in cryptography, such as the NP vs. coNP problem and constructing oblivious-transfer protocols.
412446	41244690	Join query optimization techniques for complex event processing applications	Complex event processing (CEP) is a technology used in modern applications to monitor and track important events in large data streams. CEP engines examine real-time information and try to identify combinations of events that match pre-defined patterns. This is similar to how traditional data management systems execute multi-join queries. However, there has been little research on using existing join optimization methods to improve the performance of CEP systems. This paper presents the first study of the relationship between these two areas. It proves that the CEP Plan Generation problem is equivalent to the Join Query Plan Generation problem and can be solved more efficiently using join query optimization techniques. Experiments show that these techniques outperform existing strategies for CEP optimization in terms of speed and memory usage. 
412446	412446116	Scheduling processing of real-time data streams on heterogeneous multi-GPU systems	The "online big data problem" is a common issue in modern computer systems, where vast amounts of data streams need to be processed within a known deadline. This paper focuses on adding hard real-time constraints to this problem, which is a challenging task. The system used in this paper has a central compute engine consisting of CPUs and GPUs, and a scheduler is used to decide where each data stream will be processed. The paper presents a new algorithm that achieves high utilization of the entire system (CPUs and GPUs) while meeting real-time constraints. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using an AES-CBC encryption kernel and showed a significant improvement in processing speed compared to a similar single-GPU system.
412446	41244611	Execution of monolithic Java programs on large non-dedicated collections of commodity workstations	The current computational environment consists of many interconnected workstations, but a large portion of their capacity is not being utilized due to idleness. This leads to a waste of resources. To address this, a runtime has been proposed that can execute a standard Java application on idle workstations. This runtime distributes the application's threads and objects among idle nodes, making it fault tolerant and transparent to the programmer. It is also scalable and can be used on a variety of workstations. This approach aims to utilize idle resources in non-dedicated environments and challenges the belief that communication patterns must be restricted for efficient use of idle resources.
412447	4124472	(FPT-)Approximation Algorithms for the Virtual Network Embedding Problem.	The Virtual Network Embedding Problem (VNEP) is a common issue in cloud resource allocation, where request graphs need to be mapped onto a physical infrastructure. In the offline setting, the main objectives are profit maximization and cost minimization. This problem is a generalization of routing and call admission problems, but it is not well-understood. This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation algorithms for VNEP, which use a novel linear program formulation to account for flexible mapping options and arbitrary request graph topologies. The algorithms have an exponential runtime in the request graphs' maximal width, but for fixed extraction width, they provide the first polynomial-time approximations. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of extraction orders and shows that computing minimal width extraction orders and decomposable LP solutions is NP-hard.
412447	41244735	Online Admission Control and Embedding of Service Chains	The use of virtualization and software in computer networks allows for the creation and quick implementation of new network services called service chains. These service chains are sequences of virtualized network functions that route traffic between source and destination, such as firewalls, caches, and traffic optimizers. This paper focuses on the problem of admitting and embedding the maximum number of service chains, which involves allocating network functions to handle the traffic between a maximum number of source-destination pairs. An Online variant of this problem is also considered, where requests arrive in a worst-case manner over time. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm that is O(logℓ)-competitive, assuming capacities are at least logarithmic in ℓ. The paper also explores lower bounds for offline approximation algorithms and presents an exact algorithm based on 0-1 programming for the general offline problem.
412447	41244766	Charting the Algorithmic Complexity of Waypoint Routing.	Modern computer networks have advanced to support new routing models that allow for flexible steering of traffic through a series of waypoints, such as middleboxes or virtualized network functions. These routing models enable the creation of innovative network services, such as service chains and segment routing. While the benefits and challenges of these models have been extensively studied, there is still a lack of understanding about the underlying algorithmic traffic routing problems. This paper aims to provide an overview of algorithmic techniques for waypoint routing and address the limitations caused by computational complexity. The authors compare the waypoint routing problem to classic graph theoretical problems and highlight the complexity involved in finding the shortest route through a single waypoint.
412448	41244890	Query Answering in Expressive Variants of DL-Lite	The paper discusses the use of ontologies in different application domains, such as Data Integration and the Semantic Web, where they provide access to large amounts of data. This poses a challenge in balancing the expressive power of a Description Logic with the efficiency of reasoning. The DL-Lite family of logics was designed to meet these requirements, with a focus on data complexity. The paper proposes an extension of DL-Lite called DL-Litebool, which includes full Booleans and number restrictions. Using a novel reduction to the one-variable fragment of first-order logic, the paper studies the computational and data complexity of reasoning in DL-Litebool and its sub-logics. The results provide insights into the properties of these logics and show an extension of the LogSpace upper bound for answering unions of conjunctive queries in DL-Lite to positive queries and number restrictions.
412448	41244813	Ontologies and Databases: The DL-Lite Approach	Ontologies are used to conceptualize a specific area of interest and are commonly represented using Description Logics (DLs). They are important for describing the meaning of information across different sources. The use of ontologies as a conceptual view for data repositories has gained popularity, but it is crucial that it does not add complexity to accessing the underlying data. To address this, a family of DLs called DL-Lite has been developed, which is designed to capture basic ontology and conceptual modeling languages while maintaining low complexity in reasoning and answering queries. This article discusses the major achievements of the DL-Lite family, focusing on $DL-Lite_{\mathcal{A},id}$ and its algorithms for reasoning and query answering. It also addresses the problem of accessing relational data sources through an ontology and presents a solution to the mismatch between abstract objects and data values. The QUONTO system, which implements these solutions, is also discussed. 
412448	41244811	Data Complexity of Answering Unions of Conjunctive Queries in SHIQ	The use of ontologies in accessing and querying large data repositories requires a consideration of query answering as the primary inference technique and optimizing it for data size. While the complexity of ontologies has been extensively studied, data complexity for answering more expressive query languages, such as unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs), has not been fully explored. This paper advocates for the need to study this problem and provides a significant technical contribution by proving a tight coNP upper bound for answering UCQs over SHIQ knowledge bases. The result shows that for a range of DLs, answering UCQs has coNP-complete data complexity. This is achieved through a novel tableaux-based algorithm that handles technical challenges like simultaneous inverse roles and number restrictions. 
412449	41244967	: A Tool for Automatic Composition ofServices Based on Logics of Programs	This paper presents a technique for automatic service composition and introduces a prototype software, called ESC, that implements this technique. The approach utilizes a finite state machine to characterize the behavior of a service. By using satisfiability in a variant of Propositional Dynamic Logic, the technique is able to automatically compose a client's desired service using a given set of available services. The system is open-source and can work with services described in WSDL and finite state machine languages. This allows for the creation of a composite service that fully realizes the client's specification.
412449	412449169	Automatic Composition of Web Services in Colombo	The paper introduces Colombo, a framework that characterizes web services based on message exchanges, data flow, and effects on the real world. While these aspects have been studied separately in the past, Colombo is the first attempt to address them together in one framework. This is particularly challenging when it comes to automatically composing web services. The paper also presents new techniques for synthesizing composite web services under specific assumptions.
412449	412449151	Synthesis of underspecified composite e-services based on automated reasoning	This paper explores the use of automated reasoning for the automatic composition synthesis of e-Services. The behavior of an e-Service is represented as a deterministic transition system, with the role of the e-Service as either an initiator or a servant. The authors present an algorithm based on satisfiability in a variant of Propositional Dynamic Logic to solve the automatic composition problem. The algorithm takes in a potentially incomplete specification of desired actions and a set of available e-Services, and produces a composite e-Service that only uses the available ones and follows the specified behavior. The computational complexity of the algorithm is also discussed.
412450	41245048	Project talk: coordination work and group membership in WikiProjects.	WikiProjects have played a significant role in the success of Wikipedia, but their specific contributions and methods of coordination have not been thoroughly examined. In a study analyzing discussions from 138 WikiProjects, it was found that they go beyond just content production and involve non-members in their work. This research suggests that WikiProjects have a more flexible and inclusive approach to collaboration compared to other virtual teams, and may operate similarly to open source software projects rather than traditional groups.
412450	41245042	Recommending collaboration with social networks: a comparative evaluation	This paper discusses the use of social networks in workplace collaboration and how they can be incorporated into groupware systems to improve collaboration. The study evaluates the effectiveness of two different social networks in recommending potential collaborators based on expertise. It is found that these embedded social networks do not always align with individuals' personal networks, raising concerns about their use in groupware. The paper also discusses design considerations for incorporating social networks into systems. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering social relationships in collaboration and the potential limitations of using social networks in groupware design.
412450	41245055	Building for social translucence: a domain analysis and prototype system	The article discusses the concept of social translucence and its importance in the design of large online contributor systems. Social translucence refers to the ability of users to understand their participation in a collaborative system through awareness of their contributions and interactions. The authors argue that this should be a fundamental aspect of system design, rather than something that can be added later. They conduct a domain analysis to identify the necessary architectural support for social translucence and present a system architecture that utilizes data from Wikipedia to create visualizations for users. The article concludes with reflections on the current state of social translucence research and potential future developments. 
412451	41245123	The Ethics of Knowledge Transfers and Conversions: Property or Privacy Rights?	This article discusses the ethical considerations surrounding the transfer of knowledge within organizations. It explores the question of whether organizations have the right to own and use the knowledge of their employees, or if this knowledge is the property of the individual and protected by human rights. The article suggests that organizational knowledge may be viewed as intellectual property, while personal knowledge is subject to personal privacy rights. This may lead to different knowledge management practices within organizations. Ultimately, the article highlights the importance of considering both ethical and legal implications when managing knowledge within organizations. 
412451	41245144	Genres of Inquiry in Design-Science Research: Justification and Evaluation of Knowledge Production	Design-science research is a relatively new paradigm that recognizes the importance of design in information systems development. This has led to a variety of knowledge goals and processes within a single study, making it difficult to associate any design-science research with a single view of knowledge production. Instead, these studies exhibit up to four different modes of reasoning, known as genres of inquiry, which are influenced by two dualities: the contrast between the knowledge goals of science and design, and the scope of the knowledge produced. As a result, a single design-science study may incorporate multiple genres of inquiry, each with its own criteria for knowledge justification and evaluation. This understanding of the diversity in genres of inquiry can advance the discourse on design-science research and its outcomes.
412451	4124511	Theorizing in design science research	Theory is a crucial aspect of research, and efforts have been made to better understand the process of creating theories. Two main approaches, deductive and inductive reasoning, dominate this process. However, the process of theorizing for design may involve a third approach, abductive reasoning. Design theory differs from traditional theories in that it is not focused on proving truth or falseness, but rather guiding problem-solving through the creation of a design artifact. This paper examines the process of theorizing for design and proposes an idealized framework that consists of two domains (instance and abstract) and four key activities (abstraction, solution search, de-abstraction, and registration). This framework can help in developing strong design theories within the design science paradigm by explaining the underlying process of theorizing for design.
412452	41245250	Designing an Appropriate Information Systems Development Methodology for Different Situations	The use of information systems development methodologies has grown significantly, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works for all situations. This raises the question of when to use which methodology. To address this issue, a design research approach was used to create a radar diagram with eight dimensions. Three action research cycles were then conducted to validate the design in three projects involving IT project managers. The result is an artefact that can guide the selection of a specific methodology for a particular situation. This can help practitioners and researchers make informed decisions about which methodology to use.
412452	41245242	Soft design science methodology	The paper introduces a Soft Design Science approach to design science research, which aims to improve human organizations through design, development, evaluation, and evolution of a technological artifact. This approach combines the design science research process with the soft systems methodology, and iterates the design-build-evaluation process until specific and generalized requirements are met. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through a comparison with a previously published design science study using a design-oriented action research method. Overall, the proposed methodology offers a comprehensive and iterative approach to addressing complex problems in human organizations.
412452	41245236	The Creativity Passdown Effect: Applying Design Theory In Creating Instance Design	The purpose of this paper is to explore the challenges and benefits of using a design theory (DT) to create an instance design artifact (IDA). The authors suggest that adopting a DT can lead to a "creativity passdown effect," where the creative thinking of a team of design theorists can inspire the creative mind of a team of artifact instance designers. The study examines this effect through an action case where a DT was applied to create a multi-outsourcing decision-making tool. The findings suggest that using a DT can encourage design thinking and enhance the practical relevance of IDAs. The study also challenges the notion that scientific design knowledge limits creativity by illustrating the creative elements involved in using DTs in instance design activities. This paper contributes to the literature on design science research by offering new insights on how DTs can be used in creating IDAs.

AMiner focuses on modeling researchers, their publications, and the venues where they publish, creating a comprehensive network. The system automatically extracts researcher profiles and integrates them with publication data. Currently, AMiner has collected data on over 130 million researchers and 100 million papers from various databases. The system also connects with professional social networks, enhancing the metadata. A unified topic modeling approach is used to analyze different entities and provide topic-level expertise search. AMiner also offers various researcher-centered functions, such as social influence analysis and collaboration recommendations. Since its launch in 2006, AMiner has attracted over 7 million IP accesses from 200 countries/regions. 
412453	412453159	A Unified Probabilistic Framework for Name Disambiguation in Digital Library	Despite extensive research, the issue of name ambiguity remains a major challenge. Challenges in the field include finding a comprehensive approach for name disambiguation and determining the appropriate number of individuals for the disambiguation process. In this paper, a unified probabilistic framework is proposed to address these issues by incorporating both attributes and relationships.

412454	41245463	Web page title extraction and its application	This paper discusses the automatic extraction of titles from HTML documents. While authors should accurately define titles in the title field, this is often not the case. The paper proposes a supervised machine learning approach to extracting titles and outlines a specification for what constitutes a proper HTML title. Two learning methods are used, one utilizing features from the DOM Tree and the other using visual features. Combining these methods results in significant improvements in title extraction accuracy compared to a baseline method. The paper also explores the application of extracted titles in web page retrieval, showing that using both extracted titles and title fields leads to better results than using title fields alone, particularly in the task of finding named pages.

Their method outperforms the baseline method of using the largest font size as title, with a 20.9%-32.6% improvement in F1 score. The authors also evaluate the use of extracted titles in web page retrieval, showing that the combination of extracted titles and title fields is more effective than using title fields alone, particularly in the task of named page finding with a 23.1%-29.0% improvement. The proposed method is evaluated using the TREC Web Track data.
412454	41245481	Feature selection for ranking	Ranking is a crucial aspect of information retrieval, but while there has been a lot of research on learning ranking models, little attention has been given to feature selection. Many methods used in classification are simply applied to ranking, despite the two tasks being quite different. In this paper, the authors propose a new feature selection method specifically designed for ranking. This method involves using the value of each feature to rank training instances and defining the importance of a feature based on its impact on ranking accuracy. The correlation between features is also taken into account. The feature selection problem is formulated as an optimization task, with the goal of maximizing importance scores and minimizing similarity scores. The authors also provide an efficient solution to this problem and demonstrate its effectiveness on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. The results show that this method outperforms traditional feature selection methods for ranking.
412455	41245516	A Feedback Mechanism for Network Scheduling in LambdaGrids	The future of e-Science applications will require the ability to transfer large amounts of data quickly between various computing centers and data repositories. This can be achieved through the use of a Lambda-Grid, which offers dedicated, high-speed, point-to-point connections that can be reserved for specific applications. However, this can lead to congestion at the end-systems, as their processing speeds have not kept up with networking speeds. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a lightweight end-system protocol that utilizes performance monitoring to detect potential congestion and provide feedback to the sending end-system. This protocol, called RBUDP+, improves the performance of data transfer over Lambda-Grids and has been demonstrated to be effective through network emulation.
412455	412455158	RAPID: an end-system aware protocol for intelligent data transfer over lambda grids	Next-generation e-Science applications require high-speed data transfer between distributed computing centers and data repositories. To facilitate this, lambda grid networks have been built, providing large bandwidth between endpoints through optical circuit-switched lambdas. Efficient transport protocols are needed for these dedicated circuits, as they eliminate the need for network congestion control. Previous research has shown that rate-based protocols, like RBUDP, are more effective than TCP for data transfer over lambdas. However, these protocols are not suited to handle congestion at endpoints, which can still occur with lambdas. In response, a new "Rate-Adaptive Protocol for Intelligent Delivery (RAPID)" has been developed, which uses self-monitoring and proactive feedback to adjust sending rates and improve end-to-end throughput. In testing, RAPID has been shown to reduce file transfer time and improve throughput by up to 25%.
412455	41245598	Online Power Estimation of Graphics Processing Units	Efficient power management systems require accurate power estimation at runtime. While there are accurate power models for CPUs, there is a lack of such models for GPUs. GPUs rely on low-resolution power meters, limiting their power management capabilities. To address this, a power estimator is proposed that uses performance counters in a novel way to accurately estimate power at runtime. The estimator was tested on two real NVIDIA GPUs and showed that accurate estimation is possible without the need for high-fidelity details assumed in simulation-based models. A concise set of performance counters was identified through correlation analysis, and a statistical regression technique was used to construct a multi-linear model with a 6% mean absolute error. An application-specific quadratic model further reduced the error to 1%. This model can be constructed with low overhead and high accuracy at runtime, making it the first attempt to model the instantaneous power of a real GPU system. Previous work in this area has only focused on average power.
412456	4124561	Minimizing the Data Transfer Time Using Multicore End-System Aware Flow Bifurcation	This study examines the impact of high speed network traffic, commonly used in data centers, on a commodity multicore machine.

To address this issue, they propose a flow bifurcation technique that optimizes data transfer time using rate-based protocols and determines the optimal number of parallel flows and rates to utilize available bandwidth. This approach outperforms the widely used GridFTP protocol in computational grids, particularly when end-system losses occur in the receive ring buffer.

This presents challenges when implementing the CTC system on real application traffic, as there are maximum delay requirements for the packets and potential buffer issues. To address this, the delay of multiple inter-packet delays (m-IPDs) is used to modulate the encoded symbols. The delay is partitioned to minimize buffer issues and a mathematical model is used to choose the appropriate partition for each encoded symbol. The performance of this CTC system is evaluated in real network settings and shown to be undetectable by statistical tests.
412456	41245619	Design and performance evaluation of a covert timing channel	A covert timing channel (CTC) is a method of covert communication where the sender modulates the delays between packets in a way that follows a statistical model of normal application traffic. Implementing a CTC for real application traffic, like Skype, poses challenges such as meeting end-to-end delay requirements and handling buffer overruns and underruns. To address these challenges, the authors propose using the delay of multiple inter-packet delays (IPDs) to modulate encoded symbols. They also provide a mathematical model to choose the appropriate delay partition for a given encoded symbol based on the buffer state. In experiments, this CTC system was found to be effective and difficult to detect by common statistical tests. (100 words)
412457	412457152	Dynamic Traffic Grooming in Elastic Optical Networks	Spectrum elastic optical networks offer flexible central frequency and spectrum allocation for lightpaths. However, when provisioning a new connection in these networks, the control plane must solve the problems of electrical-layer routing and optical-layer routing and spectrum assignment (RSA). This involves determining how to route the connection through new and existing lightpaths and establishing new lightpaths with limited spectrum availability. The study proposes a multi-layer auxiliary graph that addresses these issues and allows for different traffic-grooming policies. A spectrum reservation scheme is also proposed to efficiently use the flexibility of lightpaths and reduce operational costs. The results show that incorporating the reservation scheme can improve spectrum efficiency and reduce costs in various traffic-grooming policies.

Unlike traditional networks, where wavelengths are strictly defined, these networks allow for flexible tuning of transmission rates. The proposed elastic shared path protection method not only shares backup capacity among multiple paths, but also takes advantage of the tunability of transponders to share backup spectrum between adjacent paths on a link. This elasticity allows for the expansion and contraction of lightpaths, increasing spectrum efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Datacenters play a crucial role in today's computing infrastructure, and recent studies have highlighted the significance of thermal considerations for effective resource management. In this paper, the authors investigate thermal-aware scheduling for homogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) datacenters using a thermal model that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations of temperature changes. They propose an online scheduling heuristic that minimizes makespan for a set of HPC applications while adhering to a thermal constraint. The heuristic utilizes a novel concept of thermal-aware load for job assignment and thermal management. To meet the temperature constraint, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is employed, along with load balancing to improve makespan. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, highlighting the importance of considering both spatial and temporal factors in thermal-aware scheduling. The authors also reveal the benefits of using DVFS, which leads to both performance and energy gains in this context.

412459	4124598	Requirements specification via activity diagrams for agent-based systems.	Goal-oriented agent systems are becoming increasingly popular for developing complex applications in dynamic environments. However, like any software, these systems require clear and well-defined system requirements in order to be successful. In this paper, the authors propose a method for improving the understandability and maintainability of requirements in a popular agent design methodology called Prometheus. This method involves automatically generating UML activity diagrams from existing requirements models, such as scenarios and goal hierarchies. The authors believe that this approach can help reduce ambiguity in the current requirements specification and provide a more structured way of representing variations. The evaluation of this approach through user experiments showed that it enhances understanding of requirements, makes it easier to modify them, and helps ensure coverage in the detailed design of the agents. This approach can also be applied to other methodologies that use similar concepts for specifying requirements.
412459	41245939	An agent-oriented approach to change propagation in software maintenance	Software maintenance and evolution is a costly and time-consuming process in the lifecycle of a software system. This paper focuses on the change propagation problem, which involves identifying secondary changes that need to be made in response to a primary change made to meet new or modified requirements. The proposed solution is an agent-oriented approach that utilizes the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and Unified Modelling Language (UML) metamodel to specify consistency rules in the design model. The underlying change propagation mechanism is based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent architecture and incorporates event-triggered plans. The approach also includes a method for generating repair plans from OCL constraints and a mechanism for selecting the most suitable plan based on cost, taking into account cascading and synergies between constraints. An evaluation of the approach shows its effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.

To address this issue, the foundations of these systems have been re-cast into a logic programming framework, specifically using backward- and forward-chaining techniques for linear logic. This integrated system allows for interaction between the proactive and reactive parts of the system, with goals and plans being seen as declarative and procedural aspects of the same concept. The paper also discusses language design issues for such a system, emphasizing the importance of rule evaluation in a forward-chaining manner.

A framework for assessing the complexity of introductory programming exams	The level of difficulty of exam questions has a significant impact on student performance. To better understand the expected level of skills and knowledge at the end of a course, this paper explores using the assessment of question difficulty as a gauge. A subjective assessment and a specially designed complexity classification system were used to measure the difficulty of exam questions, specifically in introductory programming courses. The system considers factors such as external references, explicitness, linguistic and conceptual complexity, length of code, and intellectual complexity. The study examined 20 exam papers from five countries and found a wide range of difficulty levels. All measures of complexity were found to correlate with the assessment of difficulty, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in assessing learning standards in programming courses.

412461	41246175	Multiscale and multivariate visualizations of software evolution	Software evolution visualization is a useful tool for analyzing the development of software. By using multivariate visualization techniques, we can show complex correlations between different attributes of software evolution. This can be achieved by combining color and textures to display up to four attributes simultaneously in one view. To make this process more interactive, we have developed a method for navigating through the different attributes. Another challenge in software evolution visualization is the complexity of the data. To address this, we have proposed two new methods, isometric and isorelevance, for clustering the data and creating relevant abstraction levels. We have also introduced a new widget, the cluster map, to aid in making compromises between size and relevance when choosing a partition. These techniques have been applied to real-life industry projects, showcasing their effectiveness in analyzing software evolution.
412462	41246229	Role of calibration, validation, and relevance in multi-level uncertainty integration.	Calibrating model parameters is crucial in predicting complex systems, but lack of data makes it difficult. This paper proposes a method for quantifying uncertainty in system level predictions by integrating calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis at different levels. The approach considers the validity of models used for parameter estimation at lower levels and their relevance to the system level prediction. A model reliability metric is used to evaluate validity, and Sobol indices are used to measure relevance. These results are then integrated in a roll-up method to predict the system output. This approach allows for more accurate predictions by considering the validity and relevance of lower level tests.
412462	41246238	Model validation under epistemic uncertainty	This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of computational models when there is uncertainty in the input data. The uncertainty can be in the form of interval data, sparse point data, or probability distributions with uncertain parameters. Two approaches are used to represent these uncertain variables as probability distributions - a parametric approach and a non-parametric approach. The resulting probabilistic model predictions are compared to experimental observations, and a generalized likelihood function is used for Bayesian updating to estimate the posterior distribution of the model output. The Bayes factor metric is then used to evaluate the validity of the model and estimate the confidence in the model prediction. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed method.

Multiple sources of uncertainty are accounted for, including incoming aircraft, space availability in neighboring airports, radar performance, and communication delays. The objective is to minimize the overall distance travelled by all aircraft, subject to system resources. A novel methodology is developed to analyze the system performance and sensitivity to uncertain variables. A support vector regression model is also used to efficiently predict the system failure time distribution. This approach provides valuable insights into how uncertainty affects the system and allows for data-driven sensitivity analysis.

412463	41246325	Video orbits of the projective group a simple approach to featureless estimation of parameters.	This article presents a featureless method for estimating the eight parameters of a projective coordinate transformation to register pairs of images. This approach can be used to combine multiple images of the same scene to create a single image with greater resolution or spatial extent. The method is exact for two types of static scenes: images taken from the same location of a 3-D scene with a free-moving camera, or images of a flat scene taken from arbitrary locations. This featureless projective approach is more accurate and effective than previous methods that rely on camera models or finding correspondence between image frames. The proposed methods are also shown to be robust in various weather and lighting conditions.

412464	41246465	Second Space: A Generative Model for the Blogosphere	The Blogosphere, or the network of interconnected blogs, is a complex natural phenomenon that requires synthesized data to be accurately analyzed. While graph models are widely used to analyze the web, they are not suitable for modeling the Blogosphere due to its unique structure and dynamic nature. To address this issue, an agent-based simulation model is proposed to construct blog graphs that exhibit properties similar to real-world blog networks. This model captures the linking patterns arising in the Blogosphere through local interactions between blogs. The resulting blog and post networks have key properties such as degree distributions, degree correlation, clustering coefficient, and reciprocity. Comparing to existing web models, it is evident that a specific model for the Blogosphere is needed. The structure of these networks is influenced by the characteristics of bloggers, and they provide a macroscopic and microscopic view of the Blogosphere. 
412464	41246430	Service composition for mobile environments	Service composition refers to the creation of customized services by combining and executing existing services.

However, current wired-infrastructure based architectures do not account for factors such as mobility, device heterogeneity, and resource variability in a mobile setting. In this paper, the authors address these issues and propose a distributed architecture and protocols for service composition in mobile environments. Their approach outperforms traditional centralized protocols and is able to adapt to changing service topology and resources.
412465	41246565	On triple systems and strongly regular graphs	A Steiner triple system of order v is represented by a (v(v-1)/6,3(v-3)/2,(v+3)/2,9) strongly regular graph. While most strongly regular graphs with these parameters are the block graph of a Steiner triple system, some exceptions exist for small orders. These exceptions can be explained using the concept of switching. Similarly, Latin squares can also be treated using switching. By applying switching and constructing graphs with specific automorphisms, many new strongly regular graphs have been discovered, such as (49,18,7,6), (57,24,11,9), (64,21,8,6), (70,27,12,9), (81,24,9,6), and (100,27,10,6), which do not come from Steiner triple systems or Latin squares.

There are a total of 11,084,874,829 designs, each with its own automorphism group and number of Pasch configurations. Some of the designs are anti-Pasch. The classification process involves constructing an initial set of blocks, completing them with an algorithm, and rejecting isomorphic designs using graph labeling software and a vertex invariant. The designs can also be used in isomorphism tests for strongly regular graphs. The total number of nonisomorphic strongly regular graphs with certain parameters is estimated to be at least 11,084,874,829.

A new algorithm has been developed for the weighted case, based on a previous algorithm for the unweighted case. Experiments with random graphs show that this new algorithm is faster than previous ones. A set of weighted graphs based on constructing error-correcting codes are suggested as test cases for maximum-weight clique algorithms, and one of these graphs has led to a new record-breaking code. 
412466	41246637	HumanEva: Synchronized Video and Motion Capture Dataset and Baseline Algorithm for Evaluation of Articulated Human Motion	Research on human motion and pose estimation has made significant progress in recent years, but there has been no comprehensive evaluation of different methods to determine the current standard. To address this, the HumanEva datasets were created, which consist of synchronized video and ground-truth 3D motion data captured using a specialized hardware system. These datasets contain multiple subjects performing predefined actions with multiple repetitions, resulting in a large amount of data. Standard error measures were defined to evaluate 2D and 3D pose estimation and tracking algorithms. A baseline algorithm for 3D articulated tracking was also developed, using Bayesian filtering and optimization techniques. Experiments showed that image observation models and motion priors are important factors in performance, and that Bayesian filtering performs well in a laboratory environment with initialization. The datasets and software are available to the research community, providing a foundation for the development and comparison of new methods and establishing the current state of the art in human pose estimation and tracking.
412466	41246644	Implicit Probabilistic Models of Human Motion for Synthesis and Tracking	This paper discusses the issue of probabilistically modeling 3D human motion for synthesis and tracking. Due to the complexity of human motion, it is currently not feasible to create an explicit probabilistic model from available data. Instead, the authors propose using methods from texture synthesis, which treat images as representing an implicit empirical distribution. This involves searching a large database of example motions for similar instances of a pattern. To improve efficiency, the authors propose learning a low-dimensional linear model of human motion and using it to structure the example motion database into a binary tree. A probabilistic tree search method is then used to efficiently find a sample human motion that approximates the true distribution. This method can be used for tracking human motion and has been successfully applied within a Bayesian framework. Examples of synthesizing human motion using this model are also presented.
412466	41246641	Video-based 3D motion capture through biped control	Marker-less motion capture is a complex task, especially with only one camera. To overcome this, we use a state-space biped controller with a balance feedback mechanism to simulate human behavior and replay it in different environments. This controller is made up of simple control tasks and transitions between them are triggered by timing or proprioceptive events. We use optimal control to optimize the controller's parameters and structure, based on a comparison of simulated and observed motion. Through incremental optimization and refinement, we can automatically estimate controllers for various motions from monocular video. Our approach results in more stable controllers that closely resemble the reference motion. We demonstrate this by capturing walking, jumping, and gymnastics movements.

These are triangles with vertices at the points and no points inside. The minimum and maximum number of these triangles is determined, with different bounds depending on whether the points are inside a triangle or not. The study also looks at optimization problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum perimeter or area of these pseudo-triangles. The time complexity for solving these problems ranges from O(n^3) to O(n^6) depending on the given conditions. Additionally, the number of star-shaped pseudo-triangles is also considered, with different bounds for their minimum and maximum numbers.

This tessellation is made up of pseudo-triangles and has properties such as containing hierarchical representations of the objects and allowing for efficient intersection with line segments in the free space. The maintenance of the tessellation is done using the Kinetic Data Structure framework and is both compact and responsive. The efficiency of the structure is shown to be O(k + κmaxlog R)log N during motion of one object, and ray shooting queries can be answered in O((k + log R) log N) time.
412467	41246764	Distance-Sensitive planar point location	In this study, a data structure is proposed for efficient point location in a connected planar polygonal subdivision with n edges and a total area of 1. The structure is able to answer queries with points far from any region boundary faster, with a time complexity of $O(1+\min(\log \frac{1}{\Delta_{p}}, \log n))$. This is based on the finding that any simple polygon can be divided into a linear number of convex quadrilaterals, where the quadrilateral containing a point p has an area of at least $\Omega(\Delta_{p}^2)$.
412468	41246862	Probabilistic Wire Resistance Degradation Due to Electromigration in Power Grids.	Electromigration (EM) is a growing issue in on-chip interconnects, especially in the computing and automotive industries. It can cause wire resistances to increase, leading to performance failure in a product's lifetime. Existing EM models have limitations in accurately capturing modern copper dual-damascene (Cu DD) metallization and accounting for circuit resilience. This paper presents a new method to analyze EM's impact on wire resistance in a circuit. It considers factors such as susceptibility and statistical behavior of void evolution. The proposed criterion identifies wires at risk of failure, taking into account steady state and system lifetime. The study also shows the robustness of on-chip power grids in maintaining supply integrity despite EM failures. 
412468	412468151	The impact of electromigration in copper interconnects on power grid integrity	Electromigration (EM) is a growing issue in on-chip interconnects that can lead to increased resistance and even open circuits. However, classical circuit-level EM models have two shortcomings: they do not accurately reflect the degradation of copper dual-damascene (CuDD) metallization and they do not account for a circuit's resilience in the face of wire failures. This study addresses both of these limitations by using a probabilistic analysis that considers the variable susceptibility of different regions of CuDD wires and the statistical behavior of void formation and growth. The study also demonstrates the robustness of on-chip power grids, which can maintain supply integrity even after EM failures occur.
412468	41246861	Predicting electromigration mortality under temperature and product lifetime specifications.	Current methods for identifying electromigration-susceptible wires rely on the Blech criterion, which filters out wires that are considered "EM-immortal" based on current density. However, this criterion does not take into account product lifetime or temperature conditions, meaning that some wires deemed "Blech-mortal" may never experience electromigration during the product's lifespan. To address this issue, new methods have been developed that evaluate the transient evolution of stress in relation to product lifetime. These methods provide a more accurate and practical way of determining wire mortality. Tests on power grid benchmarks have shown that the number of mortal wires can vary greatly depending on the product's lifetime and reliability conditions.

It highlights the importance of carefully selecting algorithms, architectures, implementation styles, and synthesis techniques in designing successful VLSI processors. These transformations can help reduce silicon area or power consumption while maintaining speed, or increase speed while using the same amount of area. The paper reviews various transformation techniques such as pipelining, parallel processing, retiming, unfolding, and others, and how they can improve the suitability of an algorithm for a specific architectural style. 
412469	41246992	High-level DSP synthesis using concurrent transformations, scheduling, and allocation	This paper presents a new high-level synthesis methodology for dedicated digital signal processing (DSP) architectures in the MARS design system. The proposed algorithm utilizes inter-iteration and intra-iteration precedence constraints to perform concurrent scheduling and resource allocation, resulting in solutions that are comparable to previously published algorithms but with faster execution times. Unlike previous synthesis systems, MARS can handle DSP algorithms with randomly distributed delays, allowing for more efficient and general architectures. By unfolding, retiming, and pipelining the original data-flow graph, MARS is able to synthesize architectures that meet the iteration bound of any algorithm. 
412469	41246910	Synthesis of folded pipelined architectures for multirate DSP algorithms	This paper presents a new multirate folding transformation for designing control circuits for pipelined VLSI architectures that implement multirate algorithms. Multirate algorithms involve decimators and expanders that change the sample rate of a discrete-time signal, but multirate folding allows the algorithm to be time-multiplexed in hardware using a single-clock signal. The paper derives multirate folding equations and addresses two important issues: the minimum number of registers required in a folded architecture and how to retiming a multirate data-flow graph for a feasible schedule. This technique can be applied to a variety of digital signal processing applications, such as subband decompositions and wavelet transforms.
412470	4124709	srcType: A Tool for Efficient Static Type Resolution	The article introduces an efficient tool for resolving static types, which is based on srcML, an XML representation of source code. This tool can determine the type of every identifier in a given code body, providing a dictionary for easy lookup. The type information includes various metadata such as constness, class membership, and file information. The tool is scalable and can generate a dictionary for large codebases like Linux in under 7 minutes. It is open source and can be downloaded from srcML.org under a GPL license.
412470	41247032	A Slice-Based Estimation Approach for Maintenance Effort	Program slicing is a technique used to estimate the effort required for maintenance of a software system. A case study of the GNU Linux kernel, spanning over 900 versions and 17 years, is presented as an example. A system dictionary is created for each version using a lightweight slicing approach, which encodes the static slice profiles for all variables in the system. Changes to the system are then represented at a behavioral level using the difference between the system dictionaries of two versions. The study analyzes three different levels of slice granularity and uses a structured format to create traceability links between changes and other software artifacts. The results show that this approach is both accurate and scalable in predicting maintenance effort.
412470	41247061	Supporting source code difference analysis	The paper introduces an approach called meta-differencing, which allows for automatic extraction of additional knowledge from source-code differences. This is made possible by a source-code representation called srcML, which embeds abstract syntax in XML format while maintaining the original structure. The approach makes use of XML tools and standard differencing utilities to generate a meta-difference, represented in an XML format called srcDiff. This meta-difference provides specific syntactic information about the changes made in the source code, which can be searched and queried for further analysis. A case study using this approach on an open-source system is presented to showcase its effectiveness.
412471	412471152	Efficient User Support with DACS Scheme	The university network faces various problems when it comes to operation and management. One of these problems is user support, which often arises during changes in setups by users. This can be a time-consuming task for system administrators as they have to provide individual support to each user. Another issue is dealing with annoying communication from certain users, which requires a lot of effort and time to identify the source. To address these challenges, a new user support system called DACS (Destination Addressing Control System) Scheme is being considered. This system aims to simplify user support tasks and make network operation and management more efficient in university networks.
412471	41247135	Simplified Network Management with DACS Scheme	The university network faces various issues during operation and management, one of which is user support problems. One specific problem is dealing with annoying communication that affects the performance and speed of other users. This can be difficult and time-consuming to address, especially with DHCP Service management. To simplify this process, a new form of user support called DACS Scheme is proposed. This system intercepts communication ports and displays a warning message on the infected client's screen, prompting the user to contact the computer management section. This eliminates the need for the system administrator to physically identify the infected client, making network management more efficient.
412471	41247138	Load Experiments of the vDACS Scheme in Case of the 600 Connections by 300 Clients.	The Internet system poses various issues such as personal information leaks and cyber crimes due to the anonymity of network communication. The TCP/IP protocol used in the system does not have user identification information, making it difficult to monitor and prevent such activities. To address this problem, the Policy Based Network Management (PBNM) scheme has been proposed. This involves managing a Local Area Network (LAN) through communication control for each user. There are two types of PBNM schemes: one that places communication control mechanisms between servers and clients, and another that places them on clients. The Destination Addressing Control System (DACS) scheme has been proposed as a theoretical approach for the latter. This paper focuses on the vDACS scheme, a cloud-based PBNM system that can be used by multiple organizations. An experiment was conducted with 600 clients to demonstrate its effectiveness for small and medium-sized organizations.

412473	41247323	Bit-split string-matching engines for intrusion detection and prevention	Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems are crucial for providing security to those connected to a network. A key component of these systems is the string-matching algorithm, which allows for decisions to be made based on the actual content flowing through the network. However, as network speeds increase, this task becomes computationally intensive. To address this issue, a specialized device is needed that can maintain performance, be updated with new rules seamlessly, and be efficient enough to be integrated into existing network chips or wireless devices. Our approach involves a special purpose architecture and optimized string-matching algorithms, resulting in a system that is 10 times more efficient than existing methods. This is achieved by breaking down the database of strings into small state machines that search for a portion of the rules and bits of each rule.
412473	41247342	Patchable instruction ROM architecture	This paper discusses the increasing trend of integrating various components onto a single chip in embedded systems. This has led to the need for efficient instruction storage solutions that balance the conflicting goals of reduced area and rapid development times. The two main options currently available, ROM and Flash, have their own trade-offs and limitations. To address this, the authors propose a new architecture called Patchable Instruction ROM, which combines the benefits of both ROM and Flash by providing reduced area and limited post-fabrication software patching. The results show that this approach can achieve a 10% increase in area with only an 11% increase in design time compared to a Flash-based approach, making it a promising solution for embedded systems design.
412473	41247370	Guiding Architectural SRAM Models	The use of on-chip memory components such as caches, block memories, predictors, and state tables is increasing in processor designs. However, accurately modeling these structures can be challenging due to constantly evolving SRAM design practices and VLSI technologies. Most existing hand-built memory models are limited in their ability to account for these changes. To address this issue, the authors propose a high-level model based on the analysis of 60 real memory designs from the past 15 years. This model can be used to make simple analytical estimates and can also be used to calibrate more detailed memory models. Despite potential difficulties, the authors demonstrate that their model can accurately estimate memory density and delay using intuitive functions and automatic scaling techniques.
412474	41247418	Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks.	Our approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data uses a convolutional neural network that works directly on the graph. We use a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions to guide our choice of convolutional architecture. Our model has linear scalability with the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that capture both the local graph structure and node features. Through experiments on citation networks and a knowledge graph dataset, we show that our approach outperforms similar methods by a significant margin. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on graph data.

The presented method showed significant improvement in performance compared to these two methods, as measured by centerline distance. 
412474	41247429	Semisupervised Classifier Evaluation and Recalibration	To estimate a classifier's performance on a new dataset, a small number of labeled examples can be used if certain assumptions are made about the data structure. This approach, called Semisupervised Performance Evaluation (SPE), is based on a generative model for the classifier's confidence scores. By using SPE, performance curves with confidence bounds can be estimated, making it a useful tool for evaluating classifiers on new datasets. Additionally, SPE can also be used to recalibrate a classifier by re-estimating the class-conditional confidence distributions. This is particularly helpful when data is plentiful but labels are expensive.
412475	41247532	Network-level dynamics of diffusively coupled cells	This article discusses the study of molecular dynamics in populations of diffusively coupled cells with fast diffusive exchange. The authors propose conditions for boundedness and ultimate boundedness in systems with a singular perturbation, which expands upon existing stability results. Using these results, they demonstrate that commonly used models of intracellular dynamics lead to coordinated behavior in cell populations, with all cells converging to a common equilibrium point. The authors then focus on a specific example of coupled cells functioning as bistable switches, where the population as a whole exhibits bistable behavior by converging to a state where all cells are close to one of two equilibrium points. Finally, the practical implications of these findings for the robustness of cellular decision making in coupled populations are discussed.
412475	41247598	Identification of models of heterogeneous cell populations from population snapshot data.	Systems biology focuses on understanding the complex intracellular pathways within a "typical cell" through quantitative modeling. However, in biologically important situations, even clonal cell populations can exhibit a heterogeneous response. To study this variability, models for heterogeneous cell populations are needed. This paper presents a Bayesian approach to infer the probability density of parameters that capture the dynamics of individual cells, using population snapshot data from flow cytometric analysis. This approach can handle sparse and noisy data, and allows for assessment of parameter uncertainty. The method is evaluated using artificial data from a tumor necrosis factor signaling network model and is shown to be computationally efficient and accurate even with limited data.
412475	41247521	Live and let die—A systems biology view on cell death	This contribution discusses the authors' research on modelling biological processes, using programmed cell death (apoptosis) as an example. Apoptosis is a crucial process in the development and maintenance of multi-cellular organisms, and its misregulation can lead to severe diseases. The authors describe an ordinary differential equation model for apoptosis signalling and the concept of viewing the life and death decision as a bistable system. They also explore how small differences in model parameters can result in population heterogeneities. Using a novel modelling framework, they demonstrate how a single model can describe a population and how stable steady states can be represented as invariant sets using a local notion of stability. 
412476	412476130	Transform coding for hardware-accelerated volume rendering.	Hardware-accelerated volume rendering is the standard method for real-time rendering, but limited graphics memory can be a challenge when dealing with large volume data sets. Volumetric compression, where decompression is linked to rendering, has been proven to be an effective solution. However, most existing techniques were developed for software volume rendering and are not suitable for real-time hardware-accelerated rendering. In this paper, a new block-based transform coding scheme is proposed that addresses this issue by consolidating the inverse transform with dequantization. This approach allows for precomputation of most of the reprojection, making decompression fast without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, a new block classification scheme is introduced to preserve important features during compression. The end result is an asymmetric transform coding scheme that allows for real-time decompression of large volumes while rendering on the GPU.
412476	412476107	Multiresolution view-dependent splat based volume rendering of large irregular data	This article discusses techniques for interactive volume visualization of large, irregular data sets. Two methods for generating multiple resolutions of irregular volume grids are examined, along with a data structure that supports the splatting approach for volume rendering. These techniques are combined with a view-dependent error-based resolution selection to maintain accuracy at different zoom levels. The error tolerance can be adjusted in real time to balance frame rates and rendering accuracy. The article also presents a solution for computing gradients for lighting and demonstrates the technique on unstructured grid data from aerodynamic flow simulations. Overall, the techniques presented offer an efficient way to render irregular or meshless data sets in an interactive manner.
412476	412476175	Parallel volume rendering on the IBM Blue Gene/P	A study was conducted to assess the performance of parallel volume rendering on an IBM Blue Gene supercomputer. The goal was not to achieve real-time rendering, but rather to understand the bottlenecks and interactions between components that affect the design of future visualization solutions on these machines. Experiments were conducted under various conditions, including dataset size, number of processors, and rendering quality. The results showed that the performance was divided into three main sections: disk I/O, rendering, and compositing, and the balance between these tasks varied with the number of processors. Lessons learned from this study include the importance of balancing parallel I/O, computation, and communication in visualization on supercomputers, recommendations for optimization, and potential for further scaling. Overall, the study suggests that a distributed-memory high-performance computing architecture like the Blue Gene is suitable for large-scale visualization tasks.

It introduces a framework that takes into account the execution time of services in order to improve the overall composition. The reliability of service execution times is also emphasized, considering factors such as workload and availability. This framework aims to enhance service compositions by incorporating timely and reliable service execution. 
412477	41247735	Agent negotiation protocols in time-bounded service composition	The importance of time in service compositions is discussed in this paper, particularly in situations where a service must be delivered within a deadline. The paper proposes that service execution time, workload, and provider availability should be considered to ensure reliable service compositions. This is achieved through the use of negotiation protocols, which allow for flexibility between clients and providers participating in the composition. These protocols increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement by allowing both parties to exchange proposals and adjust the negotiation terms related to service execution time. Overall, considering time as a non-functional parameter and utilizing negotiation protocols can improve the success and reliability of service compositions.
412477	41247777	Composing and Ensuring Time-Bounded Agent Services	This paper proposes a multi-agent framework to address the complexity of service composition when there is a deadline involved.

The framework aims to optimize the service composition process by taking into account these factors and ensuring that the goals are fulfilled within the given time constraints. This can be useful in situations where agents need to work together and meet specific deadlines in order to achieve their objectives.
412478	412478109	Why Do Internet Services Fail, and What Can Be Done About It?	The article discusses the architecture, operational practices, and failure characteristics of three large-scale Internet services. Research was conducted through interviews with architects and operations staff, as well as examining operations databases and failure reports. The architecture of these services includes front-end and back-end nodes, redundancy, and custom software. Operationally, there is a close relationship between service developers and operators, and coordination is necessary for problem detection and repair. Operator error is the main cause of failures, and front-end nodes experience more problems but result in less unavailability.

However, the development of these architectures has been ad hoc and little is known about the reasons for service failures or the operational practices used to maintain them. To address this, a survey is being conducted to better understand the principles behind building highly available and maintainable Internet services. This article presents initial observations from this survey.

To address this, a methodology for benchmarking system availability is introduced, using fault injection and existing performance benchmarks. Results can be presented graphically or as numerical summaries. The methodology was applied to measure the availability of software RAID systems in Linux, Solaris 7 Server, and Windows 2000 Server. It not only quantified the impact of failure conditions, but also revealed design philosophies regarding transient errors and recovery policy. This highlights the importance of considering availability in benchmarking high-end systems.

It supports MAC layer broadcast and does not require time synchronization. The protocol is evaluated using NS-2 and results show that it can reduce channel negotiation costs and improve network throughput. It is unique in that each mobile node only needs two network interfaces.
412480	41248036	Predicting Instructor'S Intervention In Mooc Forums	Instructor intervention plays a crucial role in MOOCs, where personalized interaction is limited.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of instructor intervention and offers potential solutions for predicting it in MOOCs.
412480	41248066	Exploiting tag and word correlations for improved webpage clustering	The use of automatic webpage clustering has many benefits for information retrieval tasks. Traditionally, clustering algorithms have only used features from the page-text. However, with the rise of social-bookmarking websites, there is now a large amount of user-generated content, such as tags associated with webpages. This paper presents a new approach that combines page-text and tag information to extract more effective features for improved clustering performance. By learning a shared subspace that maximizes the correlation between these two views, any clustering algorithm can be applied. The results show that this approach outperforms other methods that use tag information in different ways. This approach can also be applied to webpage classification. Future work could explore using tag information for a smaller subset of webpages.
412480	41248074	Induction of Word and Phrase Alignments for Automatic Document Summarization	Current research in automatic single-document summarization primarily focuses on two approaches: summarization by sentence extraction and headline generation through bag-of-words models. While these methods have been successful in some tasks, they are limited in their ability to capture the various linguistic devices used by humans in producing summaries. This is because they rely on existing document and headline corpora for training data. To make progress in automatic summarization, there is a need for more sophisticated and linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective use of document and abstract corpora. To address this, the authors have developed techniques for automatically aligning words and phrases between documents and their human-written abstracts. These alignments can serve as a valuable source of data for complex summarization algorithms. The authors have conducted experiments to analyze the ability of humans to perform such alignments and have developed a model based on an extension of the hidden Markov model, which can learn to create alignments in an unsupervised manner. The results show that their model can reliably identify word and phrase-level alignments in a corpus of document and abstract pairs. 
412481	41248137	What does classifying more than 10,000 image categories tell us?	Image classification is a crucial task for both humans and computers, but one of the challenges is the large scale of the semantic space. While humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes, no computer vision algorithm has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization with more than 10,000 image classes. The authors find that computational issues are crucial in algorithm design, conventional wisdom from smaller datasets may not hold, and the structure of WordNet is strongly related to the difficulty of visual categorization. They also argue for the importance of dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy in developing automatic vision algorithms for recognizing tens of thousands or even millions of image categories.

The authors propose an approach that utilizes prior knowledge of a semantic hierarchy, resulting in significant improvements in similar image retrieval compared to current methods. Even in cases where no additional data is available, the proposed approach outperforms the current state of the art. The use of hierarchical relationships is most important for large-scale problems, and the proposed approach is parallelizable and scalable. The paper also introduces a novel hashing scheme that reduces the computational cost of retrieval. Experiments are conducted on Caltech256 and ImageNet datasets.
412482	41248264	A packet loss estimation model and its application to reliable mesh-based P2P video streaming	This paper presents a model for estimating packet loss probability in a mesh-based P2P network. The model considers factors such as channel packet drop rate, peer dynamics, and FEC protection, to account for the complex and heterogeneous packet loss behavior in a mesh network. The proposed model is able to accurately estimate packet loss and is used to develop a peer selection mechanism that can reduce packet loss propagation by selecting the most reliable child-peers to transmit redundant substreams. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and peer selection mechanism in improving the overall performance of a mesh-based P2P network.
412482	41248294	A Hybrid Sender/Receiver-Driven Error Protection Scheme For Reliable P2p Scalable Video Streaming	The paper suggests a new method for transmitting scalable video packets over peer-to-peer networks with packet loss. This method uses a combination of sender and receiver-driven strategies, where child-peers subscribe to appropriate amounts of source and channel coding packets based on the estimated system uplink capacity. To address fluctuations in bandwidth due to peer dynamics, peers use a consensus-based approach to estimate the available capacity and avoid unreliable joint source-channel coding allocations. Parent-peers also use a sender-driven approach to reject low-contribution subscriptions from potential child-peers and efficiently utilize the available bandwidth. Simulation results show that this hybrid scheme outperforms other current methods in terms of visual quality.
412482	41248296	Robust video streaming over wireless LANs using multiple description transcoding and prioritized retransmission	This paper proposes an adaptive error control scheme for compressed video in wireless LANs. The scheme has two modes, single description (SD) and multiple descriptions (MD), based on channel condition estimation. In the SD mode, a content-based prioritized retransmission method is used to mitigate error propagation caused by packet loss. In the MD mode, a channel-aware MD transcoding method is proposed to further reduce error propagation due to transient channel switching while roaming. Experimental results show that the scheme effectively reduces packet loss while maintaining low computational complexity and overhead cost, making it suitable for real-time streaming of pre-stored videos.

The authors propose a new rate-prediction model and adaptive algorithm to improve the accuracy of estimating the number of coding bits for intra and inter-block encoding. Their approach uses a linear combination of existing coding parameters, which are more closely related to entropy coding and transform coefficients. They also introduce a cost estimation function and block classification method to further enhance the accuracy of their approach. The results show that their proposed schemes outperform previous methods in terms of bit-rate and rate-distortion cost estimation.
412483	4124836	Statistical rate-distortion estimation for H.264/AVC coders	The article discusses the use of statistical analyses of transform coefficients to estimate bit-rate and distortion functions directly from spatial-domain statistics. The proposed rate and distortion estimators are shown to achieve similar results to the true rate-quantization and distortion-quantization curves through simulations. These estimators have two main applications: fast rate-distortion optimized mode decision and improved rate control in video encoding. The simulations show that the estimators have sufficient accuracy and can significantly improve performance in both applications. The rate-distortion optimized mode decision saw a 51.69% reduction in cost computation time and a 0.20 dB improvement in average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for rate-control in H.264/AVC.
412483	41248354	An Efficient Criterion for Mode Decision in H.264/AVC	This paper proposes an efficient cost function for mode decision in H.264/AVC, which is based on integer transform coefficients. The cost function jointly models the rate and distortion using the number of nonzero quantized coefficients, SAITD, and SSITD. Compared to a high-complexity cost function, the proposed one can achieve significant time savings of 79.93% for computing rate-distortion cost and 22.61% for overall encoding, with only a slight degradation of 1.05% in bit-rate and 0.049 dB in PSNR. This makes it a more practical and efficient option for mode decision in H.264/AVC.

To address these issues, a new reinforcement learning approach has been developed that monitors the learning process and allows the learner to decide when it is best to stop learning. This leads to more stable learning outcomes. 
412484	41248441	Neural reinforcement learning to swing-up and balance a real pole	The paper proposes a neural network based reinforcement learning controller that can efficiently learn control policies without the need for a transition or simulation model of the plant. The controller only requires transition experiences collected from interactions with the real plant for training. By explicitly storing these experiences, the neural Q-function can be updated in every training step, leading to a stable learning process. The algorithm was successfully applied to a real inverted pendulum, a highly nonlinear and noisy task. The proposed method was able to learn an effective policy in less than 14 minutes of real-time interaction. This approach has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and applicability of reinforcement learning in real-world systems.
412485	41248550	Differential variational inequalities	The paper discusses the use of differential variational inequalities (DVIs) in modeling various applied problems that involve dynamics, inequalities, and discontinuities. It unifies different mathematical problem classes such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), differential algebraic equations (DAEs), and dynamic complementarity systems. Conditions are presented for converting DVIs to equivalent ODEs and for numerically solving them using an Euler time-stepping procedure. The convergence of this procedure is established for initial-value and boundary-value DVIs with a maximum index of two and absolutely continuous solutions. The paper also addresses a class of DVIs for which traditional methods are not applicable. 
412485	41248567	Lyapunov Stability of Complementarity and Extended Systems	The article discusses the properties of a linear complementarity system (LCS) which is a linear dynamical system with an algebraic variable that must be a solution to a linear complementarity problem (LCP). The authors use a quadratic Lyapunov function to analyze the exponential and asymptotic stability of the LCS, taking into account the nonsmoothness of the function. They also introduce copositivity conditions to verify stability and provide examples to illustrate their results. Additionally, they extend the local stability theory to nonlinear complementarity systems and differential variational inequalities, showing that the existence of a "B-differentiable Lyapunov function" is necessary and sufficient for exponential stability.
412485	41248586	Linear Complementarity Systems: Zeno States	The paper discusses the concept of a linear complementarity system (LCS), which is a hybrid dynamical system consisting of a linear time-invariant ordinary differential equation and a finite-dimensional linear complementarity problem (LCP). The paper focuses on addressing the issues of Zeno states and finite mode switches in LCS. The study uses an expansion of the LCS solution trajectory near a given state, based on the observability degree of the state. This leads to the establishment that an LCS with the P-property does not have strongly Zeno states. The analysis is then extended to a broader class of problems and provides conditions for a state to be weakly non-Zeno. The paper's findings are novel and complement those of other authors who have studied mode-switching in hybrid systems. 
412486	41248632	A shape-based camera angle-invariant retrieval scheme for 3D objects	 Camera angle-invariant object retrieval is essential in various applications such as security, surveillance, and place recognition. However, to achieve this, we need object images at every angle, leading to a large image database. Existing indexing schemes are not suitable for handling such a huge database, resulting in performance issues. To address this problem, a new indexing and matching scheme is proposed in this paper, focusing on two types of camera movements: horizontal rotation and fixed rotation. This scheme involves two levels of indexing structures to reduce the space requirement, namely static indexing for horizontal angle invariance and dynamic indexing for rotation invariance. Implementation of this scheme in a prototype image retrieval system showed better performance compared to other methods.
412486	41248613	Pruning and Matching Scheme for Rotation Invariant Leaf Image Retrieval	For efficient content-based image retrieval, diverse visual features like color, texture, and shape are used. For leaf images, blade-based matching is more effective than whole shape-based matching due to the unique shape of leaves. Rotational invariance is crucial for matching accuracy, and a new shape representation and matching scheme called RI-PDTW is proposed in this paper. The shape representation is a distance curve, and the matching algorithm includes techniques to speed up the process. A prototype system was implemented and showed better performance than other schemes.
412486	41248616	Shape-based indexing scheme for camera view invariant 3-D object retrieval	Camera view invariant 3-D object retrieval is a crucial aspect in various applications such as security, surveillance, CAD, virtual reality, and place recognition. One approach to achieve this is by considering all possible camera views of 3-D objects, but this requires a significant amount of time and effort. Additionally, storing and maintaining these views for efficient retrieval can be challenging. To address this issue, a new shape-based indexing and matching method is proposed. This involves a camera view skimming scheme that utilizes the symmetric shape feature of objects to reduce the number of camera views to be indexed. This results in better storage efficiency, faster matching, and high retrieval accuracy, as demonstrated through experiments. 
412487	41248763	Clairvoyance: look-ahead compile-time scheduling.	Hardware designs have been developed to improve the performance of memory-bound applications by hiding memory latency. This is achieved through the use of out-of-order (OoO) execution engines, but this comes at the cost of increased energy consumption. Contemporary processor cores offer a range of performance and energy efficiency options, from fast and power-hungry OoO processors to slower, but more efficient in-order processors. This proposal suggests using a simple OoO core, which strikes a balance between performance and energy efficiency, to achieve higher performance for memory-bound applications. This is made possible by using a new compile-time technique called Clairvoyance, which overcomes limitations such as unknown dependencies, insufficient independent instructions, and register pressure. Clairvoyance can improve execution time by up to 13% while maintaining high performance for compute-bound applications.
412487	41248760	The load slice core microarchitecture	The development of microprocessor cores has been driven by the desire to expose instruction-level parallelism (ILP). This has led to the evolution of simple, in-order pipelines into complex, superscalar out-of-order designs. These processors not only extract ILP, but also allow for parallel cache and memory operations. However, the increasing cost of memory access in many-core processors has highlighted the need for extracting memory hierarchy parallelism (MHP) while also focusing on energy efficiency. To address this, a new core microarchitecture called the Load Slice Core has been proposed. It adds a second pipeline to the efficient in-order core, allowing for memory accesses and address-generating instructions to bypass stalled instructions. This results in a 53% performance improvement with only a 15% increase in area and 22% increase in power consumption compared to a baseline in-order processor. In addition, for power- and area-constrained many-core designs, the Load Slice Core outperforms both in-order and out-of-order designs, providing a promising direction for future processors.
412487	41248745	SWOOP: software-hardware co-design for non-speculative, execute-ahead, in-order cores.	The demand for energy efficiency is increasing, which poses challenges for new hardware developments. This requires a rethinking of existing software optimization techniques and a cross-layer redesign of compilers and microarchitecture. In order to address the bottleneck of last-level cache misses, a software-hardware co-design approach is proposed. This approach utilizes a non-speculative, execute-ahead paradigm called SWOOP, which aims to hide memory latency and increase memory and instruction level parallelism. Unlike traditional out-of-order architectures, which use expensive and power-hungry speculative mechanisms, SWOOP shifts this complexity into software. It incorporates compilation techniques from VLIW, software pipelining, and software prefetching, and is enhanced with lightweight architectural support. This allows for efficient transformation of applications with complex control-flow and indirect memory accesses.
412488	41248814	Vehicle routing in a Spanish distribution company: Saving using a savings-based heuristic.	The article discusses a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) faced by a large distribution company in Northeast Spain. The company has a diverse fleet of vehicles with different capacities and makes multiple trips per day to distribute products to 400 stores across the country. This variant of the VRP, known as Heterogeneous Fleet and Multi-trip VRP, has not been extensively studied. To solve the problem, the company uses a simple algorithm based on the savings heuristic with a biased-randomization effect and three local search operations. This approach has resulted in savings of around 12% in transportation costs, equivalent to €30 000 per week.
412488	41248833	Development and assessment of the SHARP and RandSHARP algorithms for the arc routing problem	The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves finding the most efficient route for a vehicle to service customers' demands located on edges of a graph. This is different from the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), where demands are located on nodes of a complete graph. While the CVRP has been extensively studied, there is a lack of research on the CARP. This paper proposes a new heuristic and two algorithms for the CARP, including a savings-based heuristic inspired by the Clarke and Wright algorithm for the CVRP. The results show that the new heuristic is more efficient than the traditional heuristic and can be integrated into meta-heuristics for solving larger CARPs. The paper also presents two randomized algorithms that use biased probability distributions to introduce randomness while still maintaining the heuristic's effectiveness. The results show that the randomized version of the new heuristic is superior to the randomized version of the traditional heuristic. 
412488	41248834	A multi-start randomized heuristic for real-life crew rostering problems in airlines with work-balancing goals.	This paper presents a multi-start randomized heuristic algorithm for solving crew rostering problems in airlines. The algorithm takes into account realistic constraints, regulations, and rules that have previously been overlooked in the literature. It aims to provide high-quality solutions that satisfy these real-life specifications and promote a fair distribution of workload among crewmembers. This approach is important for corporate social responsibility and has not been widely considered in previous research, which often uses simplified models and unrealistic benchmarks. Experimental tests show that the algorithm can generate feasible solutions to real-life problems in just a few seconds, which is significantly faster than current methods used by airlines.

However, current mobile transactions lack non-repudiation, which can be a problem for security. To address this issue, a new protocol is proposed that involves an "observer" to coordinate transactions and overcome the computing limitations of PTDs. This protocol integrates various cryptology techniques to ensure fairness, non-repudiation, anonymity, efficient verification, simplicity, and practicability. As PTDs are more portable and personal than personal computers, this scheme is expected to be widely used in PTD applications, facilitating mobile commerce and providing convenience to users in daily life.
412489	41248926	A PTD-based transaction protocol for public transportation	The increasing use of personal trusted devices (PTDs) and advancements in wireless network technology have created an ideal opportunity for personalized services to be offered to mobile users. In this paper, the use of PTDs as a payment tool in a mobile transaction system for public transportation is proposed. To address the limited computing resources of PTDs, a trusted observer is used to coordinate the transaction and incorporate cryptology measures such as digital signatures and one-way hash functions. This scheme meets the necessary requirements for mobile transactions, including fairness, non-repudiation, anonymity, and offline capability. The portability and personal nature of PTDs, along with the importance of public transportation in daily life, make this proposal a practical and innovative use of PTDs in mobile commerce.

412490	41249070	Software Pipelining for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Instruction Set Processors	This paper discusses the effectiveness of software pipelining for generating code for coarse-grained reconfigurable instruction set processors. The proposed technique combines operation assignment and software pipelining, which optimizes instruction generation and scheduling for reconfigurable processors. This is in contrast to traditional compilers that perform these steps separately. By utilizing the reconfigurable resources more efficiently, the combined approach leads to a reduced cycle count. Additionally, the paper introduces a method for exploiting spatial computation within the reconfigurable unit, resulting in further cycle count reduction. The key to this technique is the assignment algorithm, which enables successful usage of software pipelining for reconfigurable processors. 
412490	41249030	Fault-Tolerant Compact Routing Based on Reduced Structural Information in Wormhole-Switching Based Networks.	Massively parallel computers (MPCs) are necessary to meet the increasing demand for computational power. These machines require a compact routing scheme and optimal routing algorithm to minimize communication delays. However, in a massively parallel system, failures can occur and corrupt the regular network structure. To overcome this, a compact fault-tolerant routing algorithm is proposed for meshes. This algorithm uses a reduced amount of structural information and is deadlock-free without the need for extra hardware or buffering. Wormhole routing is commonly used in MPCs and involves dividing messages into smaller units called flits. The paper presents a fault-tolerant routing algorithm and a dedicated compact routing technique for deadlock-free routing.
412491	41249119	A Privacy-Preserving Solution for Tracking People in Critical Environments	In highly sensitive environments, strict security measures are necessary to control physical access and monitor the location of individuals. The use of RFID technology allows for tracking and logging of people's movements, providing crucial information in case of a security incident. However, this solution raises privacy concerns. This paper proposes an RFID-based technique that allows for tracking while preserving privacy by introducing uncertainty into the tracking process. This approach implements the k-anonymity property, where the probability of correctly identifying a person's location at a given time is k-1. The proposed technique is cost-effective and has been successfully evaluated in experiments.
412491	41249179	Approximating sliding windows by cyclic tree-like histograms for efficient range queries	The main challenge in dealing with data streams is providing fast and approximate answers to range queries on sliding windows while using minimal storage space. These queries are important as they allow for the extraction of abstract knowledge from the data stream. Techniques such as histograms are effective in handling these queries, but they require multiple scans on data. In this paper, a novel histogram-based technique is proposed that supports hierarchical queries and allows for quick query answering. The method also incorporates a bit-saving approach for compressing the sliding window with minimal loss in accuracy. Experimental analysis shows that this technique outperforms existing methods. 
412491	41249148	Reducing data stream sliding windows by cyclic tree-like histograms	Data reduction is an important step in the KDD process that helps in providing concise and meaningful data for further stages. When dealing with continuous data streams, it is essential to reduce them effectively to enable efficient mining techniques that require multiple scans. One common type of query in KDD is sum range queries, and this paper proposes a histogram-based approach for reducing sliding windows and supporting approximate sum range queries. The hierarchical structure of the histogram allows for hierarchical queries, drill-down and roll-up operations, as well as efficient sliding window shifting and quick query answering. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing techniques in terms of accuracy for histogram-based sliding window reduction.

The authors introduce the elimination algorithm, which can efficiently find and check minimal models for a subset of positive CNF theories called positive bead-cycle-free (HCF) theories. They also show that this algorithm is more effective for minimal entailment than for all positive CNF theories. The paper concludes by demonstrating how variations of the elimination algorithm can be used for efficient querying in disjunctive deductive databases and default theories. This research was published in 1997 by Elsevier Science B.V.

A criterion is presented for measuring the abnormality of combinations of attribute values in comparison to the rest of the population. Two types of properties, global and local, are distinguished, with global properties explaining the abnormality within the entire population and local properties explaining it within a selected subpopulation. The article presents a formal characterization of this problem and proposes efficient algorithms for identifying both global and local abnormal properties. Experimental evidence shows that these algorithms are effective in mining meaningful information while examining only a small portion of the search space.
412492	41249210	On the tractability of minimal model computation for some CNF theories	This paper discusses the importance of designing algorithms for efficiently constructing minimal models of Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) theories in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). It presents new algorithms for performing minimal model finding and checking on positive propositional CNFs, as well as model minimization on propositional CNFs. The Generalized Elimination Algorithm (GEA) is introduced, which can compute a minimal model for any positive CNF. The complexity of the GEA depends on the specific eliminating operator used, but an incomplete variant called IGEA is proposed to handle more complex theories. The main contribution of this work is the expansion of the tractability frontier for these problems.
412493	41249320	TSEB: More Efficient Thompson Sampling for Policy Learning	In this paper, the authors propose a new algorithm called TSEB, which is based on Thompson Sampling and aims to solve the problem of learning in an unknown environment with tighter PAC guarantees. The algorithm maintains distributions over the model parameters and uses an exploration bonus to generate more informative exploration. This allows for better PAC bounds and helps to update the posterior over the model parameters. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm's PAC guarantees and show that the adaptive exploration bonus encourages additional exploration for better performance. Empirical analysis on simulated domains supports the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
412493	4124935	Edge Replacement Grammars: A Formal Language Approach for Generating Graphs.	Graphs are commonly used to represent structured data and a generative model that closely resembles the structure of a given set of graphs can be useful in various fields. However, current approaches require a large number of parameters to be estimated from the data, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper, the authors propose a graph generation model based on Probabilistic Edge Replacement Grammars (PERGs) and introduce a variant called Restricted PERG (RPERG). This model is able to learn the parameters of the grammar from graph data and outperforms existing methods. Despite being a context-free grammar, RPERG is able to accurately capture the structural properties of real networks. 
412493	41249368	Identification of rhetorical roles for segmentation and summarization of a legal judgment	Legal judgments can be complex, making it difficult for readers to quickly understand their content. To address this issue, experts create brief summaries called headnotes. However, generating these headnotes manually is time-consuming, leading to attempts at automating the process. The challenge with automatically generated summaries is that they lack coherence and do not convey the relative importance of different parts of the judgment. This paper proposes a comprehensive system that uses machine learning to label sentences with their rhetorical roles and extract structured headnotes from legal judgments. The system was trained using an annotated data set created by legal experts. Results show that the system is effective in segmenting and summarizing judgments, improving readability and efficiency. It can also be extended to other legal sub-domains with the addition of simple features.

This can greatly improve the efficiency of the agents in solving complex tasks. By understanding the causal relationships between actions and their effects on different features of the environment, agents can learn incrementally and autonomously using Bayesian network structure and structured dynamic programming algorithms. The authors also introduce a novel active learning scheme that uses intrinsic motivation to maximize the efficiency of learning the structure of the environment. This approach allows for a developmental learning process in which agents continuously acquire new knowledge and skills as they explore their environment.

Machine learning algorithms are widely used in various fields and can range from simple data analysis to achieving super-human performance. It is important to ensure that these algorithms behave ethically and do not cause harm to humans or exhibit biased behaviors. To address this issue, a new framework for designing machine learning algorithms is proposed, which simplifies the process of identifying and regulating undesirable behaviors.

This approach allows for faster learning and efficient use of concepts. The technique is demonstrated on a Tic-Tac-Toe system, T2, which is able to achieve near-perfect play using only end-game state concepts and a two-ply search bound. This is significantly faster than achieving perfect play without concepts.

412495	41249539	Generalized Power Method for Sparse Principal Component Analysis	This paper introduces a new approach to sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA) and proposes two single-unit and two block optimization formulations for extracting sparse dominant principal components from a data matrix. These formulations involve nonconvex functions, but they are rewritten into an optimization program that involves maximizing a convex function on a compact set. This reduces the dimension of the search space, making the problem more computationally feasible. The paper also presents a simple gradient method that is effective in cases where the objective function or the feasible set are strongly convex.

This approach has potential applications in computer graphics and geometry.
412496	41249616	Ray tracing of Steiner patches	Steiner patches are triangular surface patches defined by quadratic polynomial functions of two variables. Recent research has discovered that these patches can also be expressed as a degree four polynomial in x,y,z, and the parameters of a point on the surface can be computed as rational polynomial functions of x,y,z. This has led to a more efficient algorithm for ray tracing Steiner patches, as the ray intersection equation is also a degree four polynomial in the parameter of the ray. This new method is a significant improvement over previous techniques for ray tracing free-form surface patches.
412496	41249618	Topologically consistent trimmed surface approximations based on triangular patches	This article discusses a method for approximating trimmed surfaces that are defined by two tensor-product surface patches intersecting in a smooth curve segment. The approximations are created using triangular Bézier patches that match the tangent planes of the original surfaces. To ensure topological consistency, the hypotenuse sides of the triangular patches must be coincident. This requires solving a linear system of equations. The remaining scalar freedoms and additional control points can be used to improve the accuracy and smoothness of the approximated surfaces. This method can be applied to models described by any bicubic surface patches through a subdivision process.
412497	41249753	Directed and undirected network evolution from Euler–Lagrange dynamics	This paper investigates the evolution of undirected and directed networks using the Euler-Lagrange equation and the von Neumann entropy. The equation is used to develop a variational principle based on the entropy, and correlations in the degree difference are used to determine changes in entropy over time. The model is applied to three complex network models and is found to effectively capture both undirected and directed structural transitions. It is then applied to real-world networks, including stock price data from the NYSE and gene regulatory networks in Drosophila. The model accurately simulates degree statistics and detects anomalous network evolution. Overall, the model accurately captures topological variations in evolving networks.
412497	41249740	Entropic Graph Embedding via Multivariate Degree Distributions.	The paper discusses the lack of research on using structural characterizations for embedding, clustering, and classification of directed graphs, compared to the existing methods for undirected graphs. The authors propose a new method for characterizing the structure of directed graphs, based on the distribution of the von Neumann entropy and the in and out-degree configurations associated with directed edges. This distribution is encoded as a multi-dimensional histogram and used for principal components analysis to embed directed graphs into a low dimensional space. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on artificial and real-world data. 
412497	412497115	Graph characterizations from von Neumann entropy	The paper discusses the use of von Neumann entropy as a measure of graph complexity. A simplified form of this entropy is developed, which can be calculated using node degree statistics. This is compared to Estrada's heterogeneity index, and a new connection is revealed between the two measures. The paper also explores the combination of von Neumann entropy with thermodynamic depth, which has been shown to be more effective in measuring complexity than other spectral graph theory-based measures. The accuracy of the simplified von Neumann entropy is evaluated through experiments, and its application in characterizing protein-protein interaction networks is discussed.
412498	41249845	Conceptual clustering in information retrieval	Clustering is a technique used in information retrieval systems to organize documents into groups based on their associations with each other. This is achieved by examining the index terms or user feedback on queries. Characterizing these clusters can further enhance the retrieval process. In this paper, the authors propose a method for developing clusters and characterizations using a user viewpoint elicited through a structured interview based on personal construct theory. This approach results in a more effective way of organizing and assigning documents to clusters, improving both the query process and the assignment of new documents. 
412498	41249831	Query Formulation through Knowledge Acquisition	In information retrieval systems, the interpretation of keywords in a query may not match the user's intended meaning due to language ambiguity. Conceptual queries aim to solve this issue by creating a semantic representation of relevant concepts using a set of keywords. However, it can be challenging for users to formulate these queries due to the complexity of specifying keywords and their relationships for each concept. This paper introduces a technique that uses knowledge acquisition to identify relevant concepts and examples of related documents. A representation of each concept is then created for use in the query. The system was validated and evaluated through experiments.
412498	412498115	User Profiles for Information Retrieval	An information retrieval system responds to user queries by retrieving a set of bibliographic citations. However, the system may struggle to understand different users' perspectives on keywords, as individuals may use the same terms with different meanings. To address this issue, the authors propose a technique for constructing user profiles, which are developed by eliciting user opinions and vocabulary using Personal Construct Theory. These profiles are then used to correlate user vocabulary with the system's index terms, allowing for a more personalized and accurate retrieval of information. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through experiments.
412499	41249945	Smashing the Gadgets: Hindering Return-Oriented Programming Using In-place Code Randomization	The rise of non-executable page protections in popular operating systems has led to an increase in return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks, which allow for arbitrary code execution without injecting any code. Existing defenses against ROP exploits require source code or have a high runtime overhead, limiting their effectiveness for third-party applications. This paper introduces in-place code randomization, a practical mitigation technique that can be applied directly to third-party software. By using narrow-scope code transformations that do not change the location of basic blocks, in-place code randomization can safely randomize stripped binaries without adding any code. This technique effectively eliminates and breaks a large portion of useful instruction sequences found in PE files. It also does not introduce any measurable runtime overhead, making it compatible with other exploit mitigations such as address space layout randomization. The evaluation showed that in-place code randomization successfully prevented the exploitation of vulnerable Windows 7 applications and thwarted attempts to bypass it through alternative ROP payloads.
412499	41249934	Compiler-Assisted Code Randomization	Despite extensive research, only address space layout randomization has been widely used as a defense against software exploits. Code randomization, another effective technique, has been limited by the lack of a streamlined deployment model and compatibility issues with existing software practices. In response, the authors propose compiler-assisted code randomization (CCR), which uses a combination of compiler and rewriter tools to quickly and seamlessly randomize code on end-user systems. This is achieved by embedding metadata in binaries and using a simple binary rewriter to reorder basic blocks. Their experiments show that CCR has a relatively small file size increase and negligible runtime overhead, making it a practical and compatible solution for code randomization.
412499	41249930	Protecting COTS Binaries from Disclosure-guided Code Reuse Attacks.	Code diversification and execute-only memory are effective in defending against just-in-time code reuse attacks. However, existing methods for combining these techniques often require compiler support and the use of a hypervisor, which may not be feasible for legacy or closed-source software. To address this, the paper presents SECRET, a software hardening technique that provides the same level of protection as execute-only memory without relying on hardware or recompilation. SECRET uses code space isolation and code pointer remapping to prevent read access to protected code, and also thwarts code pointer harvesting attacks on ELF files. It has been successfully implemented on 32-bit Linux systems with only a 2% increase in runtime overhead, making it more efficient than compiler-based methods. Additionally, SECRET can handle low-level machine code, providing better protection coverage.
