Under the relaxed strict-Turnstile model, CC dramatically improves the standard algorithm based on symmetric stable random projections, especially as α → 1. A direct application of CC is to estimate the entropy, which is an important summary statistic in Web/network measure- ment and often serves a crucial "feature" for data mining. The Renyi entropy and the Tsallis entropy are functions of the αth frequency moments; and both approach the Shan- non entropy as α → 1. A recent theoretical work suggested using the αth frequency moment to approximate the Shan- non entropy with α = 1+δ and very small |δ| (e.g., < 10−4). In this study, we experiment using CC to estimate fre- quency moments, Renyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Shan- non entropy, on real Web crawl data. We demonstrate the variance-bias trade-off in estimating Shannon entropy and provide practical recommendations. In particular, our ex- periments enable us to draw some important conclusions: • As α → 1, CC dramatically improves symmetric stable random projections in estimating frequency moments, Renyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Shannon entropy. The improvements appear to approach "infinity."'}

In this paper, the word-line voltages are optimized by maximizing the mutual information (MI) of the quantized channel. The enhanced precision from a few additional reads allows frame error rate (FER) performance to approach that of full-precision soft information and enables an LDPC code to significantly outperform a BCH code. A constant-ratio constraint provides a significant simplification in the optimization with no noticeable loss in performance. For a well-designed LDPC code, the quantization that maximizes the mutual information also minimizes the FER in our simulations. However, for an example LDPC code with a high error floor caused by small absorbing sets, the MMI quantization does not provide the lowest frame error rate. The best quantization in this case introduces more erasures than would be optimal for the channel MI in order to mitigate the absorbing sets of the poorly designed code. The paper also identifies a trade-off in LDPC code design when decoding is performed with multiple precision levels; the best code at one level of precision will typically not be the best code at a different level of precision.'}

413	41342	Computing Shortest Paths among Curved Obstacles in the Plane	{'title': 'Computing Shortest Paths among Curved Obstacles in the Plane', 'text': 'A fundamental problem in computational geometry is to compute an obstacle-avoiding Euclidean shortest path between two points in the plane. The case of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this article, we consider the problem version on curved obstacles, which are commonly modeled as splinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a convex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons), and the combinatorial complexity of each curved edge is assumed to be O(1). Given in the plane two points s and t and a set s of h pairwise disjoint splinegons with a total of n vertices, after a bounded degree decomposition of S is obtained, we compute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons in O(n &plus; h\u2009log\u2009h &plus; k) time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the geometric structures of the input and is upper bounded by O(h2). The bounded degree decomposition of S, which is similar to the triangulation of the polygonal domains, can be computed in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time or O(n &plus; h\u2009log\u20091 &plus; &epsi;h) time for any &epsi; > 0. In particular, when all splinegons are convex, the decomposition can be computed in O(n &plus; h\u2009log\u2009h) time and k is linear to the number of common tangents in the free space (called “free common tangents”) among the splinegons. Our techniques also improve several previous results: (1) For the polygon case (i.e., when all splinegons are polygons), the shortest path problem was previously solved in O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time, or in O(n &plus; h2log\u2009n) time. Thus, our algorithm improves the O(n &plus; h2log\u2009n) time result, and is faster than the O(n\u2009log\u2009n) time solution for sufficiently small h, for example, h=o(&sqrt;n,logn. (2) Our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a basic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among h pairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of n vertices. Our algorithm runs in O(n &plus; h\u2009log\u2009h &plus; k) time and O(n) working space, where k is the number of all free common tangents. Note that k &equals; O(h2). Even for the special case where all splinegons are convex polygons, the previously best algorithm for this visibility problem takes O(n &plus; h2log\u2009n) time. (3) We improve the previous work for computing the shortest path between two points among convex pseudodisks of O(1) complexity each. In addition, a by-product of our techniques is an optimal O(n &plus; h\u2009log\u2009h) time and O(n) space algorithm for computing the Voronoi diagram of a set of h pairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of n vertices.'}

414	41446	Contour maps: monitoring and diagnosis in sensor networks	{'title': 'Contour maps: monitoring and diagnosis in sensor networks', 'text': "Large-scale sensor networks impose energy and communication constraints, thus it is difficult to collect data from each individual sensor node and process it at the sink. In this paper, we propose an efficient data-collection scheme that can be used for event monitoring or network-wide diagnosis. Our scheme relies on the well-known representation of data--contour maps, which trade off accuracy with the amount of samples. The scheme consists of three novel algorithms to build contour maps: distributed spatial and temporal data suppression, contour reconstruction at the sink via interpolation and smoothing, and an efficient mechanism to convey routing information over multiple hops. By reducing the number of transmissions required to convey relevant information to the sink, the proposed contour mapping scheme saves energy and improves network lifetime. In a sharp contrast to related work in this area, the scheme does not require all nodes to explicitly share information.The contour mapping scheme can be applied for tasks such as: (1) presenting a global picture of the network in both temporal and spatial domains, (2) being used as a diagnosis tool, e.g., to detect faulty sensors and to scan for residual energy, (3) working in concert with in-network aggregation schemes to further reduce the communication overhead of aggregation schemes. The proposed scheme imposes little processing and storage overhead, allowing for the sensor networking paradigm of 'dumb sensor, smart sink' which enables economical deployment of large-scale sensor networks.Simulation results show that our scheme is resilient to both high packet loss rate and measurement noise. The design is also energy efficient, resulting in up to an-order-of-magnitude power savings when compared with the base line scheme where every sensor sends its report to the sink."}

If the target velocity is known (and if the target intensity distribution is known) then the 3-D matched filter is optimal with respect to signal to noise ratio (SNR), however it suffers from velocity mismatch if the velocity is unknown. A bank of 3-D matched filters, each tuned to a different velocity, has been proposed for dealing with this problem. Alternatively one can use a new type of 3-D fan filter which passes undistorted all targets over a specified velocity set while providing maximum noise attenuation, thereby avoiding velocity mismatch. This paper obtains analytical expressions for the SNR improvement of these filters which facilitate the design of banks of these filters as well as performance trade-off studies.'}

416	41639	Demo: Rio: a system solution for sharing I/O between mobile systems	{'title': 'Demo: Rio: a system solution for sharing I/O between mobile systems', 'text': "A user nowadays owns a variety of mobile systems, including smartphones, tablets, smart glasses, and smart watches, each equipped with a plethora of I/O devices, such as cameras, speakers, microphones, sensors, and cellular modems. There are many interesting use cases in which an application running on one mobile system accesses I/O on another system, for three fundamental reasons. (i) Mobile systems can be in different physical locations or orientations. For example, one can control a smartphone's high-resolution camera from a tablet camera application to more easily capture a self-portrait. (ii) Mobile systems can serve different users. For example, one can a play music for another user if one's smartphone can access the other device's speaker. (iii) Certain mobile systems have unique I/O devices due to their distinct form factor and targeted use cases. For example, a user can make a phone call from her tablet using the modem and SIM card in her smartphone. Solutions exist for sharing I/O devices, e.g., for camera [1], speaker [2], and modem (for messaging) [3]. However, these solutions have three limitations. (i) They do not support unmodified applications. (ii) They do not expose all the functionality of an I/O device for sharing. (iii) They are I/O class-specific, requiring significant engineering effort to support new I/O devices. We demonstrate Rio (Remote I/O), an I/O sharing solution for mobile systems that overcomes all three aforementioned limitations. Rio adopts a split-stack I/O sharing model, in which the I/O stack is split between the two mobile systems at a certain boundary. All communications that cross this boundary are intercepted on the mobile system hosting the application and forwarded to the mobile system with the I/O device, where they are served by the rest of the I/O stack. Rio uses device files as its boundary of choice. Device files are used in Unix-like OSes, such as Android and iOS, to abstract many classes of I/O devices, providing an I/O class-agnostic boundary. The device file boundary supports I/O sharing for unmodified applications, as it is transparent to the application layer. It also exposes the full functionality of each I/O device to other mobile systems by allowing processes in one system to directly communicate with the device drivers in another. Rio is not the first system to exploit the device file boundary; our previous work, Paradice [5], uses device files as the boundary for I/O virtualization inside a single system. However, Rio faces a different set of challenges regarding how to properly exploit this boundary, as explained in the full paper [6]. In this demo, we use a prototype implementation of Rio for Android systems. Our implementation supports four important I/O classes: camera, audio devices such as speaker and microphone, sensors such as accelerometer, and cellular modem (for phone calls and SMS). It consists of about 7100 lines of code, of which less than 500 are specific to I/O classes. Rio also supports I/O sharing between heterogeneous mobile systems, including tablets and smartphones. See [4] for a video of the demo."}

Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible.   A method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for the shapelet-based classifiers.

418	418125	Clothing Cosegmentation for Shopping Images With Cluttered Background.	{'title': 'Clothing Cosegmentation for Shopping Images With Cluttered Background.', 'text': 'In this paper, we address an important and practical problem of clothing cosegmentation (CCS): given multiple fashion model photos with natural backgrounds on e-commerce websites, to automatically and simultaneously segment all images and extract the clothing regions. However, cluttered backgrounds, variations in colors and styles, and inconsistent human poses all make it a challenging task. In this paper, a novel CCS algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of clothing extraction by exploiting the properties of multiple clothing images with the same apparel. First, the co-salient objects are computed by detecting the upper bodies of fashion models and transferring their locations within multiple images. Based on the coarse clothing regions determined by the upper body localization and co-salient object detection, the foreground (clothing) and background Gaussian mixture models are estimated, respectively. Finally, the clothing region in each image is extracted through energy minimization based on graph cuts iteratively. The proposed cosegmentation algorithm is mainly designed for multiple clothing images. As a byproduct, it can also be applied to single image segmentation without any modification. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art cosegmentation methods as well as traditional single image segmentation solution for shopping images.'}

419	41946	Fast computation of categorical richness on raster data sets and related problems.	{'title': 'Fast computation of categorical richness on raster data sets and related problems.', 'text': 'In many scientific fields, it is common to encounter raster data sets consisting of categorical data, such as soil type or land usage of a terrain. A problem that arises in the presence of such data is the following: given a raster G of n cells storing categorical data, compute for every cell c in G the number of different categories appearing within a window centered at c. The window can either be a (2r+1)x(2r+1) square or a disk of radius r for a positive integer parameter r. We call this the categorical richness problem, and we present two algorithms for it: one for square windows that runs in O(n) time and one for circular windows that runs in O((1+K/r)n) time, where K is the number of distinct categories in G. The algorithms are not only efficient in theory, but also in practice: our experiments show that our algorithms can handle raster data of hundreds of millions of cells. The categorical richness problem is related to colored range counting, where the goal is to preprocess a colored point set such that we can efficiently count the number of colors appearing inside a query range. We present a data structure for colored range counting in R2 for the case where query ranges are squares. Our structure uses O(n polylog n) storage and has O(polylog n) query time, which is significantly better than what is known for arbitrary rectangular ranges.'}

4110	411048	How self-similar are artworks at different levels of spatial resolution?	{'title': 'How self-similar are artworks at different levels of spatial resolution?', 'text': 'Recent research has shown that a large variety of aesthetic paintings are highly self-similar. The degree of self-similarity seen in artworks is close to that observed for complex natural scenes, to which low-level visual coding in the human visual system is adapted. In this paper, we introduce a new measure of self-similarity, which we will refer to as the Weighted Self-Similarity (WSS). Using PHOG, which is a state-of-the-art technique from computer vision, WSS is derived from a measure that has been previously linked to aesthetic paintings and represents self-similarity on a single level of spatial resolution. In contrast, WSS takes into account the similarity values at multiple levels of spatial resolution. The values are linked to each other by using a weighting factor so that the overall self-similarity of an image reflects how self-similarity changes at different spatial levels. Compared to the previously proposed metric, WSS has the advantage that it also takes into account differences between self-similarity at different levels of spatial resolution with respect to one another. An analysis of a large image dataset of aesthetic artworks (the JenAesthetics dataset) and other categories of images reveals that artworks, on average, show a relatively high WSS. Similarly, high values for WSS were obtained for images of natural patterns that can be described as being fractal (for example, images of clouds, branches or lichen growth patterns). The analysis of the JenAesthetics dataset, which consists of paintings of Western provenance, yielded similar values of WSS for different art styles. In conclusion, self-similarity is uniformly high across different levels of spatial resolution in the artworks analyzed in the present study.'}

These V&V technologies range from relatively lightweight ones, such as inspection and testing, to more heavyweight technologies based on formal methods and theorem proving. For complex systems, a significant part of the cost and effort for development and maintenance is associated with V&V activities, and this almost always involves selecting and applying a mix of V&V technologies. Unfortunately, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of individual technologies or how to derive the most cost-effective combination. As such, combinations for particular projects are typically selected in an ad-hoc way. In this paper, several issues related to the selection and evaluation of combinations of V&V technologies are explored, based on personal experiences with the V&V of concurrent Java components. A V&V method is presented that was systematically derived through an analysis of the possible failures that can occur in concurrent Java components. This method combines inspection, static analysis, and dynamic testing. In addition, empirical methods that use analysis of fault data and experiments to evaluate V&V combinations are presented. Finally, ideas are presented for an iterative method that can be used to assist with both the selection and evaluation of cost-effective V&V combinations in a given context.'}

Previous research has investigated assembly sequencing under the assumption that parts have nominal geometry. This paper considers the case where parts have toleranced geometry. Its main contribution is an efficient procedure that decides if a product admits an assembly sequence with infinite translations (i.e. translations that can be extended arbitrarily far along a fixed direction), that is feasible for all possible instances of the components within the specified tolerances. If the product admits one such sequence, the procedure can also generate it. For the cases where there exists no such assembly sequence, another procedure is proposed which generates assembly sequences that are feasible only for some values of the toleranced dimensions. If this procedure produces no such sequence, then no instance of the product is assemblable. These two procedures are described for 2D assemblies made of polygonial parts and for 3D assemblies made of polyhedral parts. So far, only the first has been implemented (for the planar case). This work assumes a simple, but non-trivial tolerance language that falls short of capturing all imperfections of a manufacturing process. In particular, it assumes that faces and edges have perfect relative orientations. Thus, it is only one step towards dealing with tolerances in assembly sequencing.'}

In this letter, a novel algorithm is proposed based on the prior knowledge that edges of weak reflection are always smoother than most edges of observed objects. To filter out the edges of weak reflection, an MRF-EM (Markov Random Field and Expectation Maximization) framework is proposed.

It uses signed and certified messages and is based on two underlying failure detection modules. The first is a muteness failure detection module of the class ♦M. The second is a reliable Byzantine behaviour detection module. More precisely, the first module detects processes that stop sending messages, while processes experiencing other non-correct behaviours (i.e., Byzantine) are detected by the second module. The protocol is resilient to F faulty processes, F ≤ min(⌊(n - 1)/2⌋, C) (where C is the maximum number of faulty processes that can be tolerated by the underlying certification service).The approach used to design the protocol is new. While usual Byzantine consensus protocols are based on failure detectors to detect processes that stop communicating, none of them use a module to detect their Byzantine behaviour (this detection is not isolated from the protocol and makes it difficult to understand and prove correct). In addition to this modular approach and to a consensus protocol for Byzantine systems, the paper presents a finite state automaton-based implementation of the Byzantine behaviour detection module. Finally, the modular approach followed in this paper can be used to solve other problems in asynchronous systems experiencing Byzantine failures.'}

DVB-H uses a time-sliced transmission scheme to reduce the power consumption used for radio reception. Tune-in time in DVB-H refers to the time between the start of the reception of a broadcast signal and the start of the media rendering. One of the significant factors in tune-in time is the time from the start of media decoding to the start of correct output from decoding, which is minimized when a time-slice is started with a random access point picture such as an independent decoding refresh (IDR) picture in H.264/AVC. In IPDC over DVB-H, encapsulation to time-slices is performed independently from encoding in a network element called IP encapsulator. At the time of encoding, time-slice boundaries are not known exactly, and it is therefore impossible to govern the location of IDR pictures relative to time-slices. It is proposed that an additional stream consisting of IDR pictures only is transmitted to the IT encapsulator, which replaces pictures in a normal bitstream with IDR pictures according to time-slice boundaries in order to achieve the minimum tune-in time. It has to be ensured that the "spliced" stream resulting from the operation of the I? encapsulator complies with the Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD) specification of H.264/AVC. A video encoding and rate control system is proposed to satisfy the HRD requirements for the spliced stream. Simulation results show that in addition to fulfilling HRD compliancy, good average quality of decoded video is achieved with minimum tune-in time.'}

The users can locally cache up to MF information bits. Each user can connect simultaneously to r helpers. All links in the network (from the server to the helpers, and from the helpers to the users) have normalized capacity of F bits per unit time. We study the achievable download time, expressed in multiples of the time necessary to transmit F bits over a link. In particular, we are interested in minimizing the worst-case download time over all possible demand configurations and realizations of the user-helper connectivity. We present a simple scheme that combines network-coded multicasting and MDS coding and achieves a speed-up factor of 1/r in download time with respect to the case where the server is connected directly to the users through a shared multicast link. We also show that the achieved performance is order-optimal (up to at most a logarithmic factor) in the regime where the total system cache memory is large with respect to the file library size.'}

4120	41208	A Universal Ordinary Differential Equation.	{'title': 'A Universal Ordinary Differential Equation.', 'text': 'An astonishing fact was established by Lee A. Rubel (1981): there exists a fixed non-trivial fourth-order polynomial differential algebraic equation (DAE) such that for any positive continuous function phi on the reals, and for any positive continuous function epsilon(t), it has a C^infinity solution with | y(t) - phi(t) | u003c epsilon(t) for all t.  Lee A. Rubel provided an explicit example of such a polynomial DAE. Other examples of universal DAE have later been proposed by other authors.However, while these results may seem very surprising, their proofs are quite simple and are frustrating for a computability theorist, or for people interested in modeling systems in experimental sciences. First, the involved notions of universality is far from usual notions of universality in computability theory. In particular, the proofs heavily rely on the fact that constructed DAE does not have unique solutions for a given initial data. This is very different from usual notions of universality where one would expect that there is clear unambiguous notion of evolution for a given initial data, for example as in computability theory. Second, the proofs usually rely on solutions that are piecewise defined. Hence they cannot be analytic, while analycity is often a key expected property in experimental sciences.  Third, the proofs of these results can be interpreted more as the fact that (fourth-order) polynomial algebraic differential equations is a too loose a model compared to classical ordinary differential equations. In particular, one may challenge whether the result is really a universality result.The question whether one can require the solution that approximates phi to be the unique solution for a given initial data is a well known open problem [Rubel 1981, page 2], [Boshernitzan 1986, Conjecture 6.2]. In this article, we solve it and show that Rubelu0027s statement holds for polynomial ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and since polynomial ODEs have a unique solution given an initial data, this positively answers Rubelu0027s open problem. More precisely, we show that there exists a fixed polynomial ODE such that for any phi  and epsilon(t) there exists some initial condition that yields a solution that is epsilon-close to phi at all times.The proof uses ordinary differential equation programming. We believe it sheds some light on computability theory for continuous-time models of computations.  It also demonstrates that ordinary differential equations are indeed universal in the sense of Rubel and hence suffer from the same problem as DAEs for modelization: a single equation is capable of modelling any phenomenon with arbitrary precision, meaning that trying to fit a model based on polynomial DAEs or ODEs is too general (if ithas a sufficient dimension).'}

The existing solutions for the graph searching problem suffer however from a serious drawback: they are mostly centralized and assume a global synchronization mechanism for the searchers. In particular: (1) the search strategy for every network is computed based on the knowledge of the entire topology of the network, and (2) the moves of the searchers are controlled by a centralized mechanism that decides at every step which searcher has to move, and what movement it has to perform. This paper addresses the graph searching problem in a distributed setting. We describe a distributed protocol that enables searchers with logarithmic size memory to clear any network, in a fully decentralized manner. The search strategy for the network in which the searchers are launched is computed online by the searchers themselves without knowing the topology of the network in advance. It performs in an asynchronous environment, i.e., it implements the necessary synchronization mechanism in a decentralized manner. In every network, our protocol performs a connected strategy using at most k+1 searchers, where k is the minimum number of searchers required to clear the network in a monotone connected way using a strategy computed in the centralized and synchronous setting."}

4122	412254	Streamlining data cache access with fast address calculation	{'title': 'Streamlining data cache access with fast address calculation', 'text': 'For many programs, especially integer codes, untolerated load instruction latencies account for a significant portion of total execution time. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a fast address generation mechanism capable of eliminating the delays caused by effective address calculation for many loads and stores. Our approach works by predicting early in the pipeline (part of) the effective address of a memory access and using this predicted address to speculatively access the data cache. If the prediction is correct, the cache access is overlapped with non-speculative effective address calculation. Otherwise, the cache is accessed again in the following cycle, this time using the correct effective address. The impact on the cache access critical path is minimal; the prediction circuitry adds only a single OR operation before cache access can commence. In addition, verification of the predicted effective address is completely decoupled from the cache access critical path. Analyses of program reference behavior and subsequent performance analysis of this approach shows that this design is a good one, servicing enough accesses early enough to result in speedups for all the programs we tested. Our approach also responds well to software support, which can significantly reduce the number of mispredicted effective addresses, in many cases providing better program speedups and reducing cache bandwidth requirements.'}

Guided by the practical constraints and requirements of traffic classification in large networks, in this article, we explore the design of an accurate and scalable machine learning based flow-level traffic classification system, which is trained on a dataset of flow-level data that has been annotated with application protocol labels by a packet-level classifier. Our system employs a lightweight modular architecture, which combines a series of simple linear binary classifiers, each of which can be efficiently implemented and trained on vast amounts of flow data in parallel, and embraces three key innovative mechanisms, weighted threshold sampling, logistic calibration, and intelligent data partitioning, to achieve scalability while attaining high accuracy. Evaluations using real traffic data from multiple locations in a large ISP show that our system accurately reproduces the labels of the packet level classifier when runs on (unlabeled) flow records, while meeting the scalability and stability requirements of large ISP networks. Using training and test datasets that are two months apart and collected from two different locations, the flow error rates are only 3&percnt; for TCP flows and 0.4&percnt; for UDP flows. We further show that such error rates can be reduced by combining the information of spatial distributions of flows, or collective traffic statistics, during classification. We propose a novel two-step model, which seamlessly integrates these collective traffic statistics into the existing traffic classification system. Experimental results display performance improvement on all traffic classes and an overall error rate reduction by 15&percnt;. In addition to a high accuracy, at runtime, our implementation easily scales to classify traffic on 10Gbps links.'}

We model an IP/ATM network with and without ATM shortcuts as two loss networks. We propose a metric for network performance comparison, the network load ratio, that gives the ratio of the number of flows accepted by two networks at the same network blocking probability. We derive an estimator of this metric, the asymptotic load ratio, that has low computational complexity. This estimator forms the basis of a methodology for network performance comparison. We use this method in simulation experiments using random networks. These experiments indicate that in many cases the utilization of an IP/ATM network increases proportionally to the decrease in the average path length when ATM shortcuts are used. We have also found that there is almost no correlation between the increase in network utilization (when using ATM shortcuts) and the IP to ATM node ratio'}

In this paper, we propose a scalable and flexible framework integrating proxy-based prefix caching with periodic broad- cast of the suffix of a video from the server, for efficiently streaming a set of popular videos to a large number of asynchronous clients. We de- velop a methodology for (i) determining appropriate prefix and suffix transmission schemes based on a principle of decoupling the two trans- missions from each other, and (ii) optimally allocating the proxy buffer space among the set of videos. A buffer allocation algorithm is presented that minimizes the aggregate bandwidth usage on the server-proxy path. Our studies show that our approach yields a buffer allocation close to the optimal solution minimizing both server-proxy and proxy-client path bandwidth usage for practical settings where the proxy-client path band- width is much cheaper than the long-haul server-proxy path bandwidth. When the proxy buffer is allocated to a set of videos using our scheme, a total buffer space of just of the video repository is adequate to realize substantial reductions in the aggregate bandwidth usage on the server-proxy path.'}

On top of this a wide variety of applications has different requirements with regard to quality, reliability and security from the underlying networks. The number of stakeholders who participate in provisioning of network and services is growing. More demanding applications (like eGovernment, eHealth, critical and emergency infrastructures) are on the rise. Therefore we assume that these two basic characteristics, a) multiple authorities and b) applications with very diverse demands, are likely to stay or even increase in the Internet of the future. In such an environment federation and virtualization of resources are key features that should be supported in a future Internet. The ability to form slices across domains that meet application specific requirements enables many of the desired features in future networks. In this paper, we present a Multipath Routing Slice experiment that we performed over multiple federated testbeds. We combined capabilities from different experimental facilities, since one single testbed did not offer all the required capabilities. This paper summarizes the conducted experiment, our experience with the usability of federated testbeds and our experience with the use of advanced measurement technologies within experimental facilities. We believe that this experiment provides a good example use case for the future Internet itself because we assume that the Internet will consist of multiple different infrastructures that have to be combined in application specific overlays or routing slices, very much like the experimental facilities we used in this experiment. We also assume that the growing demands will push towards a much better measurement instrumentation of the future Internet. The tools used in our experiment can provide a starting point for this.'}

In our model the algorithm only knows areas within which each of the input points lie, and is required to identify the maximal points or points on the convex hull correctly by updating some points (i.e., determining their location exactly). We compare the number of points updated by the algorithm on a given instance to the minimum number of points that must be updated by a nondeterministic strategy in order to compute the answer provably correctly. We give algorithms for both of the above problems that always update at most three times as many points as the nondeterministic strategy, and show that this is the best possible. Our model is similar to that in [3] and [5].'}

We consider a general jointly correlated MIMO channel model. We first propose an optimal transmission scheme to maximize the ergodic sum capacity, which reveals the transmit signals of all base stations are mutual independent and the optimal signaling directions are the eigenvectors of the transmit correlation matrix of the MIMO channel. Then we employ the matrix permanents to derive a closed-form tight upper bound for the ergodic sum capacity.

Support vector machines (SVMs) represent a powerful class of nonlinear classifiers, and reducing the working precision represents a promising approach to achieving e_cient implementations of the SVM classification phase. However, the relationship between SVM classification accuracy and the arithmetic precision used is not yet su_ciently understood. We investigate this relationship in floating-point arithmetic and illustrate that often a large reduction in the working precision of the classification process is possible without loss in classification accuracy. Moreover, we investigate the adaptation of bounds on allowable SVM parameter perturbations in order to estimate the lowest possible working precision in floating-point arithmetic. Among the three representative data sets considered in this paper, none requires a precision higher than 15 bit, which is a considerable reduction from the 53 bit used in double precision floating-point arithmetic. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytic bounds on the working precision for SVMs with Gaussian kernel providing good predictions of possible reductions in the working precision without sacrificing classification accuracy.'}

It is shown that using the class of the optimal rotation matrices, the performance of BICM-ID systems over a Rayleigh fading channel approaches that of the BICM-ID systems over an AWGN channel when the dimension of the signal constellation increases. Furthermore, by exploiting the sigma mapping for any M-ary QAM constellation, a very simple sub-optimal, but yet effective iterative receiver structure suitable for signal constellations with large dimensions is proposed.

The existing approach to reformulate the design as a matrix rank-one constrained optimization problem is highly inefficient. This paper exploits the d.c. (difference of two convex functions) structure of the objective function and the convex structure of the constraints in such a global optimization problem to develop efficient iterative algorithms of very low complexity to find the solutions. Both cases of concurrent and orthogonal transmissions from sources to relays are considered. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithms provide solutions that are very close to the upper bound on the solution of the non-orthogonal source transmissions case and are almost equal to the optimal solution of the orthogonal source transmissions case. This demonstrates the ability of the developed algorithms to locate approximations close to the global optimal solutions in a few iterations. Moreover, the proposed methods are superior to other methods in both performance and computation complexity.'}

Design and maintenance of such a hierarchy is a difficult task that is often accomplished without any clear guidance or tool support. Formal concept analysis provides a natural theoretical framework for this problem because it can guarantee maximal factorization while preserving specialization relationships. The framework can be useful for several software development scenarios within the class hierarchy life-cycle such as design from scratch using a set of class specifications, or a set of object examples, refactoring/reengineering from existing object code or from the observation of the actual use of the classes in applications and hierarchy evolution by incrementally adding new classes. The framework can take into account different levels of specification details and suggests a number of well-defined alternative designs. These alternatives can be viewed as normal forms for class hierarchies where each normal form addresses particular design goals. An overview of work in the area is presented by highlighting the formal concept analysis notions that are involved. One particularly difficult problem arises when taking associations between classes into account. Basic scaling has to be extended because the scales used for building the concept lattice are dependent on it. An approach is needed to treat this circularity in a well-defined manner.

The quality of the information flow is used as a key performance indicator to conduct network changes after group disappearance. Nodes as well as node sets are first classified into categories (critical and non-critical nodes, and scattered, contiguous and hybrid groups) and then analyzed according to two distinct perspectives: the network as a whole or its identified communities. Finally, algorithms are devised to manage group disappearance according to different cases. New links are added in a parsimonious way and a possible substitute for a leaving group is found based on the adage “birds of a feather flock together” and the homophily principle. This means that new links (e.g., relationships) and a potential substitute are found only between individuals that share common characteristics such as beliefs, values, and education, i.e., individuals that are more likely neighbors of the leaving node or group. To validate our approach, an empirical study is conducted using various kinds of data sets and a set of criteria. The results show the benefits of our solution in terms of response time, number of added links and metrics of the overall network topology.'}

4150	415068	Compressive Sensing Based Soft Video Broadcast Using Spatial and Temporal Sparsity.	{'title': 'Compressive Sensing Based Soft Video Broadcast Using Spatial and Temporal Sparsity.', 'text': 'Video broadcasting over wireless network has become a very popular application. However, the conventional digital video broadcasting framework can hardly accommodate heterogeneous users with diverse channel conditions, which is called the cliff effects. To overcome this cliff effects and provide a graceful degradation to multi-receivers, in this paper, we use the nonlocal sparsity and hierarchical GOP structure to propose a novel CS based soft video broadcast scheme. CS has properties of minimizing bandwidth consumption and generating measurements with equal importance which are exactly needed by video soft broadcast. In the proposed scheme, the measurement data are generated by block-wise compressive sensing (BCS), and then the measurement data packets are sent over a highly dense constellation though OFDM channel to achieve a simple encoder. Ideally, with the GOP structure, inter frame has lower sampling rate than intra frame to achieve better compression efficiency. At the decoder side, due to equally-important packets and property of soft broadcast, each user can receive the noise-corrupted measurements matching its channel condition and reconstruct video. The hierarchical GOP structure is presented to explode the correlation and non-local sparsity among video frames during the recover process. Additionally, using non-local sparsity, group based CS reconstruction with adaptive dictionaries is proposed to improve decoding quality. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides better performance compared with the traditional SoftCast with up to 8 dB coding gain for some channel conditions.'}
4150	415047	Compressed Image Restoration via External-Image Assisted Band Adaptive PCA Model Learning	{'title': 'Compressed Image Restoration via External-Image Assisted Band Adaptive PCA Model Learning', 'text': 'Visually annoying compression artifacts frequently appear in block-based transform coding at low bit rates, due to coarse and independent quantization of transform coefficients in coding blocks. This paper presents a subband adaptive modeling framework for reducing quantization artifacts. In this framework, each patch is jointly regularized by bandwise distribution priors adaptively learned in its PCA transform domain together with a quantization constraint prior in the DCT domain. Since the compression artifacts influence the covariance statistics of coded image patches remarkably, external images are utilized to provide more robust PCA domains for patch sparse modeling. Instead of using a global distribution model for all patches, the distribution prior of each patch is adaptively learned from similar patches within the compressed image itself to address the non-stationarity of image signals. The coefficients in different PCA bands are regularized unequally according to the learned priors. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of both the objective and the perceptual qualities.'}

Based upon an anisotropic image model, this paper analyzes the effect of transform orders in terms of theoretical coding gain. Our results reveal that the transform orders have little effect on the coding gain with full decomposition, good directional modes and good interpolation. However, in practical compression schemes, since high-pass bands are not decomposed fully because of the consideration on complexity, different transform orders have different coding performances, which can be solved by an adaptive transform order. Motivated by our analyzed results, a directional filtering transform (dFT, in order to distinguish from the common usage on DFT) is proposed in this paper to better exploit correlations among samples in H.264 intraframe coding. It provides an evenly distributed set of prediction modes with an adaptive transform order. Both interblock and intrablock correlations are exploited in this scheme. Experimental results in H.264 intraframe coding demonstrate its superiority both objectively and subjectively.'}

Results show that ESCOT can achieve comparable coding performance with the state-of-the-art MPEG-4 verification model (VM) 13.0 while having the scalability and flexibility of the bitstream in low bit-rate object-based video coding.

We observe that discarding low-priority (LP) data and saving the channel uses for high-priority (HP) data can significantly improve the quality of the received video. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the total squared error of a multi-variant Gaussian random vector under the given bandwidth and power resources. To tame the complexity of this NP-hard problem, we analyze two sub-problems, namely power allocation and bandwidth allocation, and propose an iterative algorithm to approximate the solution. Subsequently, we propose a one-pass two-step fast algorithm that further reduces both algorithmic and computational complexity.

To tackle the problem that the underlying cost function to pursue minimal rank is hard to solve, an effective way is to employ smooth non-convex surrogate log vertical bar XXT vertical bar for the rank penalty. Essentially, such technique only considers to utilize correlation within image patches. In this paper, we propose to jointly exploit both intra- and inter-patch correlation of the input image, so as to further reduce the uncertainty of the signal, and thus improve the prediction of the latent image. The corresponding two surrogates are integrated to incorporate both intra- and inter-patch correlation. To solve the optimization problem, we use iterative alternating direction technique to divide the problem into two subproblems, each of which is solved via an empirical Bayesian procedure built upon variational approximation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and perceptual quality.'}

During the video transmission, the channel throughput available to the video encoder in the wireless systems is inherently variable, due to the retransmission of the error packets using the automatic repeat request (ARQ) error control. The variable data rate of the wireless system is characterized by the packet-level Gilbert two-state Markov Model, the parameters of which are extracted from the statistical properties of the channel information obtained from the wireless channel simulator. The proposed algorithm adopts a fast but effective block-based segmentation method to extract the regions of interest. Unlike traditional bit allocation methods used in the region/content-based rate control, the algorithm exploits the most effective criteria "coding qualities" as quantitative factors to directly control bit allocation among different regions so as to achieve better visual quality in the regions of interest. The computational complexity of the algorithm is low making it suitable for real-time applications. Compared with the MPEG-4 rate control algorithm, our algorithm can effectively enhance the perceptual quality for the regions of interest and significantly reduce the number of frame skipping; thereby, improve the smoothness of the video.'}

Dynamic modeling of PV solar modules is useful when used in switching circuits and grid-connected situations. The dynamic elements of the proposed model are a fractional-order inductor and capacitor of two independent orders which allow for two extra degrees of freedom over the conventional dynamic model. The step response and transfer function of the load current are investigated for different orders under resistive and supercapacitor loading conditions. Closed-form expressions for the time response of the load current at equal orders of capacitor and inductor are derived. Stability analysis of the load current transfer function is carried out for different orders and loading conditions. The regions for pure real and pure imaginary input admittance scenarios are calculated numerically for both resistive and supercapacitor load cases. It is found that the order of the inductor has a dominant effect on the responses. As a proof of concept, the model is fitted to experimental data to show its flexibility in regenerating the actual response. The fitted fractional-order model response is compared to optimized integer-order ones from literature showing noticeable improvement.'}

Model checking is a formal verification technique tuned for finding corner-case errors by comprehensively exploring the state spaces defined by a system. File systems have two dynamics that make them attractive for such an approach. First, their errors are some of the most serious, since they can destroy persistent data and lead to unrecoverable corruption. Second, traditional testing needs an impractical, exponential number of test cases to check that the system will recover if it crashes at any point during execution. Model checking employs a variety of state-reducing techniques that allow it to explore such vast state spaces efficiently.We built a system, FiSC, for model checking file systems. We applied it to four widely-used, heavily-tested file systems: ext3, JFS, ReiserFS and XFS. We found serious bugs in all of them, 33 in total. Most have led to patches within a day of diagnosis. For each file system, FiSC found demonstrable events leading to the unrecoverable destruction of metadata and entire directories, including the file system root directory “/”.'}

They have state (defined both by the interface's data structures and internally), operations on this state (defined by the interface's procedures), and semantics associated with these operations. Given a way to incorporate interface semantics into compilation, interfaces can be compiled in the same manner as traditional languages such as ANSI C or FORTRAN. This paper makes two contributions. First, it proposes and explores the metaphor of interface compilation, and provides the beginnings of a programming methodology for exploiting it. Second, it presents Magik, a system built to support interface compilation. UsingMagik, software developers can build optimizers and checkers for their interface languages, and have these extensions incorporated into compilation, with a corresponding gain in efficiency and safety. This organization contrasts with traditional compilation, which relegates programmers to the role of passive consumers, rather than active exploiters of a compiler's transformational abilities."}

Since a set of documents can be considered as a semi-structured dataset or database, we want to query these documents. Moreover in many applications we need to transform documents into other documents, containing the same information, but with a different structure. Finally, most documents are represented in HTML on the Web, which can be seen as XML-documents. We discuss sublanguages of XPath, XQuery and XSLT. The latter are wellused manipulation languages for XML that were developed during the last decade in which we can express these queries and transformations. XPath is a simple language that enables us to navigate through a document. XQuery is a powerful query language for XML and XSLT is a transformation language. These three languages are conceptually totally different. For each of them we have defined an upward compatible sublanguage respectively MiXPath, MiXQuery and MiXSLT. These are three manipulation languages for XML, whose semantics is defined in a formal, uniform, compact and elegant way. These three languages will enable us later on to investigate more easily certain aspects such as the expressive power of certain types of expressions found in XPath, XQuery and XSLT, the expressive power of recursion and possible syntactical restrictions that let us control this power, the complexity of deciding equivalence of expressions for purposes such as query optimization, the functional character in comparison with functional languages such as LISP and ML, the role of XPath 1.0 and 2.0 in XQuery in terms of expressive power and query optimization, and the relationship between queries on XML and the classical well-understood concept of generic database queries. The contribution of MiXPath, MiXQuery and MiXSLT is their relatively simple syntax and semantics that is appropriate both for educational and research purposes. Indeed, we are convinced that these languages have a number of interesting properties, that can be proved formally, and that can be transposed to XPath, XQuery and XSLT.'}

The majority of these systems use value-based indexes (e.g., B+-trees) for physical storage, and ignore many of the structural aspects present in RDF graphs. Structural indexes, on the other hand, have been successfully applied in XML and semi-structured data management to exploit structural graph information in query processing. In those settings, a structural index groups nodes in a graph based on some equivalence criterion, for example, indistinguishability with respect to some query workload (usually XPath). Motivated by this body of work, we have started the SAINT-DB project to study and develop a native RDF management system based on structural indexes. In this paper we present a principled framework for designing and using RDF structural indexes for practical fragments of SPARQL, based on recent formal structural characterizations of these fragments. We then explain how structural indexes can be incorporated in a typical query processing workflow; and discuss the design, implementation, and initial empirical evaluation of our approach."}

However, the inherently dynamic nature of grid workflow scheduling, stemming from the unavailability of scheduling information and from resource contention among the (multiple) workflows and the non-workflow system load, may lead to poor or unpredictable performance. In this paper we present a comprehensive and realistic investigation of the performance of a wide range of dynamic workflow scheduling policies in multicluster grids. We first introduce a taxonomy of grid workflow scheduling policies that is based on the amount of dynamic information used in the scheduling process, and map to this taxonomy seven such policies across the full spectrum of information use. Then, we analyze the performance of these scheduling policies through simulations and experiments in a real multicluster grid. We find that there is no single grid workflow scheduling policy with good performance across all the investigated scenarios. We also find from our real system experiments that with demanding workloads, the limitations of the head-nodes of the grid clusters may lead to performance loss not expected from the simulation results. We show that task throttling, that is, limiting the per-workflow number of tasks dispatched to the system, prevents the head-nodes from becoming overloaded while largely preserving performance, at least for communication-intensive workflows.'}

The performance of co-allocation may be severely impacted by the slowintercluster connections, and by the types of job requests. We distinguish different job request types ranging from ordered requests that specify the numbers of processors needed in each of the clusters, to flexible requests that only specify a total. We simulate multicluster systems with the FCFS policy-- and with two policies for placinga flexible request, one tries to balance cluster loads and one tries to fill clusters completely--to determine the response times under workloads consistingof a single or of different request types for different communication speeds across the intercluster connections. In addition to a synthetic workload, we also consider a workload derived from measurements of a real application on the DAS. We find that the communication speed difference has a severe impact on response times, that a relatively small amount of capacity is lost due to communication, and that for a mix of request types, the performance is determined not only by the separate behaviours of the different types of requests, but also by the way in which they interact.'}

The pressure for advances is increased by the fast evolution of single, large clusters, which are the primary technological alternative to grids. However, advances in grid resource management cannot be achieved without an appropriate toolbox, of which simulation environments form an essential part. The current grid simulation environments still lack important workload and system modeling features, and research productivity features such as automated experiment setup and management. In this paper we address these issues through the design and a reference implementation of DGSim, a framework for simulating grid resource management architectures. DGSimintroduces the concepts of grid evolution and of job selection policy, and extends towards realism the current body of knowledge on grid inter-operation, on grid dynamics, and on workload modeling. We also show through two real use cases how DGSimcan be used to compare grid resource management architectures.'}

However, the large scale, the wide geographical spread, and at times the decision of the rightful resource owners to commit the capacity elsewhere, raises serious resource availability issues. Little is known about the characteristics of the grid resource availability, and of the impact of resource unavailability on the performance of grids. In this work, we make first steps in addressing this twofold lack of information. First, we analyze a long-term availability trace and assess the resource availability characteristics of Grid’5000, an experimental grid environment of over 2,500 processors. The average utilization for the studied trace is increased by almost 5%, when availability is considered. Based on the results of the analysis, we further propose a model for grid resource availability. Our analysis and modeling results show that grid computational resources become unavailable at a high rate, negatively affecting the ability of grids to execute long jobs. Second, through trace-based simulation, we show evidence that resource availability can have a severe impact on the performance of the grid systems. The results of this step show evidence that the performance of a grid system can rise when availability is taken into consideration, and that human administration of availability change information results in 10–15 times more job failures than for an automated monitoring solution, even for a lowly utilized system.'}

A common practice on this topic is the so-called Info-Kmeans, which performs K-means clustering with KL-divergence as the proximity function. While expert efforts on Info-Kmeans have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with high-dimensional sparse data such as text corpora. Indeed, it is possible that the centroids contain many zero-value features for high-dimensional text vectors, which leads to infinite KL-divergence values and creates a dilemma in assigning objects to centroids during the iteration process of Info-Kmeans. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm for Info-Kmeans clustering. Specifically, by using an equivalent objective function, SAIL replaces the computation of KL-divergence by the incremental computation of Shannon entropy. This can avoid the zero-feature dilemma caused by the use of KL-divergence. To improve the clustering quality, we further introduce the variable neighborhood search scheme and propose the V-SAIL algorithm, which is then accelerated by a multithreaded scheme in PV-SAIL. Our experimental results on various real-world text collections have shown that, with SAIL as a booster, the clustering performance of Info-Kmeans can be significantly improved. Also, V-SAIL and PV-SAIL indeed help improve the clustering quality at a lower cost of computation.'}

To provide continued performance improvements without increasing power, regardless of the sequential or parallel nature of the application, microarchitectural energy efficiency must improve. We propose Dynamically Specialized Datapaths to improve the energy efficiency of general purpose programmable processors. The key insights of this work are the following. First, applications execute in phases and these phases can be determined by creating a path-tree of basic-blocks rooted at the inner-most loop. Second, specialized datapaths corresponding to these path-trees, which we refer to as DySER blocks, can be constructed by interconnecting a set of heterogeneous computation units with a circuit-switched network. These blocks can be easily integrated with a processor pipeline. A synthesized RTL implementation using an industry 55nm technology library shows a 64-functional-unit DySER block occupies approximately the same area as a 64 KB single-ported SRAM and can execute at 2 GHz. We extend the GCC compiler to identify path-trees and code-mapping to DySER and evaluate the PAR-SEC, SPEC and Parboil benchmarks suites. Our results show that in most cases two DySER blocks can achieve the same performance (within 5%) as having a specialized hardware module for each path-tree. A 64-FU DySER block can cover 12% to 100% of the dynamically executed instruction stream. When integrated with a dual-issue out-of-order processor, two DySER blocks provide geometric mean speedup of 2.1X (1.15X to 10X), and geometric mean energy reduction of 40% (up to 70%), and 60% energy reduction if no performance improvement is required.'}

These are dynamic regions of programs where most of the instructions are devoted to memory access or address computation. These occur naturally in programs because of workload properties, or when employing an in-core accelerator, we get induced phases where the code execution on the core is access code. We observe such code requires an OOO core's dataflow and dynamism to run fast and does not execute well on an in-order processor. However, an OOO core consumes much power, effectively increasing energy consumption and reducing the energy efficiency of in-core accelerators. We develop an execution model called memory access dataflow (MAD) that encodes dataflow computation, event-condition-action rules, and explicit actions. Using it we build a specialized engine that provides an OOO core's performance but at a fraction of the power. Such an engine can serve as a general way for any accelerator to execute its respective induced phase, thus providing a common interface and implementation for current and future accelerators. We have designed and implemented MAD in RTL, and we demonstrate its generality and flexibility by integration with four diverse accelerators (SSE, DySER, NPU, and C-Cores). Our quantitative results show, relative to in-order, 2-wide OOO, and 4-wide OOO, MAD provides 2.4×, 1.4× and equivalent performance respectively. It provides 0.8×, 0.6× and 0.4× lower energy."}

In this paper, we report the different challenges when adapting the JIRS to the Arabic language.In order to evaluate JIRS on Arabic, we had to develop an Arabic test-bed using the multilingual CLEF QA one as guideline. We also report the results obtained in our experiments where we retrieved Arabic passages with JIRS first without any text preprocessing and second performing a prior light-stemming on the documents of the test-bed. The preliminary results show that it is possible to obtain a first Arabic passage retrieval system adapting JIRS on pre-processed text with a light-stemmer.'}

This family is inspired by existing genie-aided bounding mechanisms, but differs from current approaches in its optimization problem formulation and application. The fundamental idea behind these bounds is to create a group of genie receivers that form multiple access channels that can decode a subset of the original interference channel's messages. The MAC sum capacity of each of the genie receivers provides an outer bound on the sum of rates for this subset. The genie-MAC outer bounds are used to derive new sum-capacity results. In particular, this paper derives sum-capacity in closed-form for the class of K-user Gaussian degraded interference channels. The sum-capacity achieving scheme is shown to be a successive interference cancellation scheme. This result generalizes a known result for two-user channels to K-user channels."}

Outer bounds, and where possible, capacity regions of a class of interference channels is characterized. The analysis of single transmit multiple receive antenna (SIMO) Gaussian interference channels with strong interference can be easily seen to be exactly analogous to that of a single transmit single receive antenna system. This paper demonstrates that, in contrast, multiple transmit single receive antenna (MISO) Gaussian interference channels are much harder to characterize. In this paper, the capacity region for a class of MISO interference channels with very strong interference is characterized. Also, the rank of the optimal transmit policy in a MISO Gaussian interference channel is shown to be bounded by the number of users in the system. Finally, outer bounds on the capacity region of the general multiple transmit and receive antenna (MIMO) Gaussian interference channels are derived. A new outer bound is obtained, which combines and improves previously known strategies for bounding the capacity of interference channels.'}

4166	416655	Using a Saliency Map for Active Spatial Selective Attention: Implementation & Initial Results	{'title': 'Using a Saliency Map for Active Spatial Selective Attention: Implementation & Initial Results', 'text': 'In many vision based tasks, the ability to focus attention on the important portions of a scene is crucial for good performance on the tasks. In this paper we present a simple method of achieving spatial selective attention through the use of a saliency map. The saliency map indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map is cre- ated through predictive autoencoding. The performance of this method is demonstrated on two simple tasks which have multiple very strong distract- ing features in the input retina. Architectural extensions and application directions for this model are presented. 1 MOTIVATION Many real world tasks have the property that only a small fraction of the available input is important at any particular time. On some tasks this extra input can easily be ignored. Nonetheless, often the similarity between the important input features and the irrelevant features is great enough to interfere with task performance. \'ho examples of this phenom- ena are the famous "cocktail party effect", otherwise known as speech recognition in a noisy environment, and image processing of a cluttered scene. In both cases, the extrane- ous information in the input signal can be easily confused with the important features, making the task much more difficult. The concrete real world task which motivates this work is vision-based road following. In this domain, the goal is to control a robot vehicle by analyzing the scene ahead, and choos- ing a direction to travel based on the location of important features like lane marking and road edges. This is a difficult task, since the scene ahead is often cluttered with extraneous features such as other vehicle, pedestrians, trees, guardrails, crosswalks, road signs and many other objects that can appear on or around a roadway. While we have had signifi- cant success on the road following task using simple feed-forward neural networks to transform images of the road ahead into steering commands for the vehicle (Pomerleau, 1993b), these methods fail when presented with cluttered environments like those encoun- 1. For the general task of autonomous navigation, these extra features are extremely important, but for restricted task of road following, which is the focus of this paper, these features are merely distractions. Although we are addressing the more general task using the techniques described here in combination with other methods, a description of these efforts is beyond the scope of this paper.'}

This paper presents a method for ascertaining the relevance of inputs by exploiting temporal coherence and predictability. The method pro- posed in this paper dynamically allocates relevance to inputs by using expectations of their future values. As a model of the task is learned, the model is simulta- neously extended to create task-specific predictions of the future values of inputs. Inputs which are either not relevant, and therefore not accounted for in the model, or those which contain noise, will not be predicted accurately. These inputs can be de-emphasized, and, in turn, a new, improved, model of the task created. The tech- niques presented in this paper have yielded significant improvements for the vision-based autonomous control of a land vehicle, vision-based hand tracking in cluttered scenes, and the detection of faults in the etching of semiconductor wafers.'}

Recently, a dictionary training algorithm called SGK has been proposed as an alternative to the well known K-SVD algorithm. Analytically it has been shown that SGK has a superior execution speed in comparison to K-SVD, and it is advantageous to use SGK for constrained sparse coding. Through synthetic data experiments it has also been shown that the SGK dictionary training performances are comparable with K-SVD. However, these claims have not been verified for real data in practice. In this article, by training dictionaries on a face image database, we made a comparison between SGK and K-SVD using the problem of image recovery (inpainting and denoising).

The system comprises two adaptive units: a filter to compensate time shift between the two receiver channels and a gain control to provide Wiener filtering. Both the filter coefficients and the variable gain are adjusted simultaneously by using modifications from the stochastic mean-square-error gradient in the traditional adaptive least-mean-square time-delay estimation (LMSTDE) method. The convergence characteristics of the proposed system are analyzed in detail and compared with those obtained by the traditional technique. Theoretical results show that, unlike the LMSTDE configuration, this arrangement can decouple the adaptation of time shift from the changing signal and/or noise power, which in turn gives rise to better convergence behavior of the delay estimate. Simulation results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the new model and corroborate the theoretical developments'}

Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an effective sensor to detect landmines that are made of plastic or have low metal content. Most GPR signal processing algorithms apply processing in the time (depth) domain. This paper proposes to use the frequency domain features from the GPR signal to improve the detection of weak plastic mines and to reduce the number false alarms due to clutter objects. The motivation comes from the fact that the energy density spectrum may be different between mine targets and clutter objects, although both may have strong GPR signal return in the time domain. Experimental results based on clutter lane data collected at a test site corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral features to increase the accuracy for landmine detection.'}
4170	417065	Depth map enhancement using adaptive steering Kernel regression based on distance transform	The content discusses the concept of "ghosting" in modern dating and relationships. Ghosting is when one person suddenly stops all communication with the other person without any explanation or closure. This behavior has become increasingly common with the rise of online dating and has a negative impact on the person who is being ghosted. It can lead to feelings of rejection, confusion, and hurt. The article suggests that the best way to handle ghosting is to move on and not take it personally. It also emphasizes the importance of clear communication and honesty in relationships.

Such regions are segmented adaptively under the predicate of focal connectivity and fused by partition synthesis. The fused image has information from all focal planes, while maintaining the visual verisimilitude of the scene. In order to validate the fusion performance of our method, we have compared our results with those of tiling and multiscale fusion techniques.

4170	417052	Automatic registration of 3D datasets using Gaussian fields	{'title': 'Automatic registration of 3D datasets using Gaussian fields', 'text': 'In this paper we introduce a new 3D automatic registration method based on Gaussian fields and energy minimization. The method defines a simple ∞ C energy function, which is convex in a large neighborhood of the alignment parameters; allowing for the use of powerful standard optimization techniques. We show that the size of the region of convergence can be significantly extended reducing the need for close initialization and overcoming local convergence problems of the standard Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithms. Furthermore, the Gaussian criterion can be evaluated with linear computational complexity using Fast Gauss Transform methods, allowing for an efficient implementation of the registration algorithm. Experimental analysis of the technique using real world datasets shows the usefulness as well as the limits of the approach. To obtain point correspondences between 3D datasets, several invariant feature extraction techniques were proposed. Methods surveyed by Campbell and Flynn (2) are mostly surface-based and use differential properties to build their representations. Most invariant feature methods assume that the partial surfaces were accurately reconstructed from the range maps. In real applications, however these surfaces are affected by noise, reducing the accuracy of invariant features registration, hence the need for further refinement using point- based techniques. The ICP algorithm is a locally convergent scheme that requires parameter initialization close to the aligned position. It operates at the point level, minimizing the mean squared distance between the datasets. Despite its popularity, ICP has several shortcomings, including the need for sufficient overlap between the datasets and local convergence. The main contribution of this work is a new point-sets registration criterion which is differentiable and convex in a large neighborhood of the aligned position. The goal was to overcome the problems of standard registration techniques, and in particular ICP. The main reason behind these limitations can be attributed to the non- differentiable cost function associated with ICP which imposed heuristic minimization and local convergence. Hence, in real applications the preliminary point-feature extraction and matching step is necessary before proceeding to what is considered an ICP-based refinement step. Recently, similar work was done on the design of approximations to non-differentiable matching and similarity measures including the work by Charpiat et al (3) on approximating Hausdorff distances by a differentiable metric on shape space, and the use of distance functions and gradient-based optimization techniques to minimize the ICP criterion (5). In our case we will use a straightforward sum of Gaussian distances that is defined for generalized point-sets with associated attributes. These attributes can be local moments computed from the datasets (12). The criterion is convex in the neighborhood of the solution and always differentiable allowing for the use of a wide range of well proven optimization techniques. Physically the method is interpreted in terms of Gaussian force fields attracting the two datasets to the correct registration, similar to the Gaussian forces encountered in particle physics. Also the method can be derived from combinatorial matching using a mollification and relaxation approach. We show that this criterion can be effectively used for registration extending the region of convergence so that we do not need close initialization. More importantly, the criterion can be evaluated, with linear computational complexity, using the recent numerical techniques known as the Fast Gauss Transform methods (4). In the following sections we first present the Gaussian energy function, present an overview of the fast evaluation method, and finally show an analysis of our approach based on several experimental results.'}

4171	417111	Optical flow-based real-time object tracking using non-prior training active feature model	{'title': 'Optical flow-based real-time object tracking using non-prior training active feature model', 'text': "This paper presents a feature-based object tracking algorithm using optical flow under the non-prior training (NPT) active feature model (AFM) framework. The proposed tracking procedure can be divided into three steps: (i) localization of an object-of-interest, (ii) prediction and correction of the object's position by utilizing spatio-temporal information, and (iii) restoration of occlusion using NPT-AFM. The proposed algorithm can track both rigid and deformable objects, and is robust against the object's sudden motion because both a feature point and the corresponding motion direction are tracked at the same time. Tracking performance is not degraded even with complicated background because feature points inside an object are completely separated from background. Finally, the AFM enables stable tracking of occluded objects with maximum 60% occlusion. NPT-AFM, which is one of the major contributions of this paper, removes the off-line, preprocessing step for generating a priori training set. The training set used for model fitting can be updated at each frame to make more robust object's features under occluded situation. The proposed AFM can track deformable, partially occluded objects by using the greatly reduced number of feature points rather than taking entire shapes in the existing shape-based methods. The on-line updating of the training set and reducing the number of feature points can realize a real-time, robust tracking system. Experiments have been performed using several in-house video clips of a static camera including objects such as a robot moving on a floor and people walking both indoor and outdoor. In order to show the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm, some experiments have been performed under noisy and low-contrast environment. For more objective comparison, PETS 2001 and PETS 2002 datasets were also used."}

The proposed method is based on an extension of barrier certificates to infinite-dimensional systems. In this respect, we introduce barrier functionals, which are functionals of the dependent and independent variables. Given a set of initial conditions and an unsafe set, we demonstrate that if such a functional exists satisfying two (integral) inequalities, then the solutions of the system do not enter the unsafe set. Therefore, the proposed method does not require finite-dimensional approximations of the distributed parameter system. Furthermore, for PDEs with polynomial data, we solve the associated integral inequalities using semi-definite programming (SDP) based on a method that relies on a quadratic representation of the integrands of integral inequalities. The proposed method is illustrated through examples.'}

The proposed policy iteration relies on a class of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions which is non-differentiable, but continuous, and polynomial in both the state and the deadzone functions of the input signals. The second step of the policy iteration is based on a piecewise control policy improvement. An important aspect of the proposed piecewise policy is that at each step of the iteration the computed policy is globally stabilizing and the existence of an improving value function is guaranteed as well. The solution to the inequalities which is required to hold at each step of the policy iteration, is obtained by solving Sum-of-Squares Programs (SOSP) that can be efficiently implemented with semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers.'}

The main challenge of safe needle insertion is the deep location of the target, resulting in a narrow and small insertion channel close to sensitive anatomy. Recent approaches utilizing ultrasound (US) as a low-cost and widely available guiding modality are promising but have yet to become routinely used in clinical practice due to the difficulty in interpreting US images, their limited view of the internal anatomy of the spine, and/or inclusion of cost-intensive tracking hardware which impacts the clinical workflow.We propose a novel guidance system for spine anaesthesia. An efficient implementation allows us to continuously align and overlay a statistical model of the lumbar spine on the live 3D US stream without making use of additional tracking hardware. The system is evaluated in vivo on 12 volunteers.The in vivo study showed that the anatomical features of the epidural space and the facet joints could be continuously located, at a volume rate of 0.5 Hz, within an accuracy of 3 and 7 mm, respectively.A novel guidance system for spine anaesthesia has been presented which augments a live 3D US stream with detailed anatomical information of the spine.

A new method is proposed for tip localization with curvilinear arrays using local image statistics over a region extended from the partially visible needle shaft. First, local phase-based image projections are extracted using orientation-tuned Log-Gabor filters to coarsely estimate the needle trajectory. The trajectory estimation is then improved using a best fit iterative method. To account for the typically discontinuous needle shaft appearance, a geometric optimization is then performed that connects the extracted inliers of the point cloud. In the final stage, the enhanced needle trajectory points are passed to a feature extraction method that uses a combination of spatially distributed image statistics to enhance the needle tip. The needle tip is localized using the enhanced images and calculated trajectory. Validation results obtained from 150 ex vivo ultrasound scans show an accuracy of 0.43 ±0.31 mm for needle tip localization."}

Its goal is to assist a user in the process of query formulation. Current QAC systems are mainly reactive. They respond to the present request using past knowledge. Specifically, they mostly rely on query logs analysis or corpus terms co-occurrences and rank suggestions according to their similarity with the partial user query, their past popularity, or their temporal dynamics features (e.g. trends, bursts, seasonality in query popularity). Consequently, a suggestion to be recommended by the QAC system must be preceded with a substantial users' interest and ipso facto must be an old information. However, a growing amount of people turns to search engines to find novel information, that is emergent or recently created (not redundant) one. Conventional QAC systems are thus unable to fulfill the increasingly real-time needs of the users. In this work-in-progress report, we introduce a new approach to QAC - the system filtering out potentially novel information and proactively delivering it to the users. It aims at providing the users with some novel insight. Thus, it caters for their open-ended or persistent and increasingly real-time information needs. The preliminary method proposed in this paper to evaluate this approach forms time specific suggestions based on a comparison of two corpora constantly being updated with new data from chosen sources. An unsupervised and language-independent algorithm relying on relative novelty of terms co-occurrences is used to generate suggestions. The initial experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in recommending queries leading to novel information. Therefore, they prove that such a system can enhance the exploratory power of a search engine and support the proactive information search."}

The current interface for acquiring VMs from most providers, however, is too limiting for the tenants, in terms of granularity in which VMs can be acquired (e.g., small, medium, large, etc.), while giving very limited control over their placement. The former leads to VM underutilization, and the latter has performance implications, both translating into higher costs for the tenants. In this work, we leverage nested virtualization and a networking overlay to tackle these problems. We present Kangaroo, an Open Stack-based virtual infrastructure provider, and IPOPsm, a virtual networking switch for communication between nested VMs over different infrastructure VMs. In addition, we design and implement Skippy, the realization of our proposed virtual infrastructure API for programming Kangaroo. Our benchmarks show that through careful mapping of nested VMs to infrastructure VMs, Kangaroo achieves up to an order of magnitude better performance, with only half the cost on Amazon EC2. Further, Kangaroo's unified Open Stack API allows us to migrate an entire application between Amazon EC2 and our local Open Nebula deployment within a few minutes, without any downtime or modification to the application code."}

In current generation NUMAs the speed difference between the slowest and fastest link in an interconnect — the “NUMA gap” — is typically less than an order of magnitude, and many conventional parallel programs achieve good performance. We study how different NUMA gaps influence application performance, up to and including typical wide area latencies and bandwidths. We find that for gaps larger than those of current generation NUMAs, performance suffers considerably (for applications that were designed for a uniform access interconnect). For many applications, however, performance can be greatly improved with comparatively simple changes: traffic over slow links can be reduced by making communication patterns hierarchical — like the interconnect. We find that in four out of our six applications the size of the gap can be increased by an order of magnitude or more without severely impacting speedup. We analyze why the improvements are needed, why they work so well, and how much non-uniformity they can mask. Keywords Wide area networks Application sensitivity Cluster computing Orca 1 Introduction As computer systems increase in size, their interconnects become more hierarchical, resulting in growing bandwidth and latency differences in their interconnects. This trend is visible in NUMA machines and clusters of SMPs, where local memory access is typically a factor of 2–10 faster than remote accesses [19] . The gap in future large-scale NUMAs is larger, and the gap in meta-computers and computational grids is much larger. For NUMAs with a small gap good performance has been reported with conventional numerical applications [19,24] . On systems with a larger gap, such as clusters of SMPs and networks of workstations, it is harder to achieve good performance [22,25,30] . As gaps increase, it is likely that performance will continue to suffer. There is little insight in how a growing NUMA gap influences application performance, or how good performance can be achieved on systems with a large gap. This paper studies the performance of six non-trivial parallel applications, Barnes-Hut, Water, FFT, TSP, ASP, and Awari. We have built an experimental testbed using 128 Pentium Pros, a high-speed network (Myrinet) and an ATM network. The testbed can be configured as multiple Myrinet clusters that are interconnected by ATM links with different latencies and bandwidths. In this way, we can emulate a variety of NUMA/meta-computer configurations, where the gap between the fast local network (Myrinet) and the wide area network (ATM) varies from 0 to 4 orders of magnitude. The parameter settings have been calibrated using a real wide area system. The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows. We analyze the impact of a wide range of gaps between the slowest and fastest links of the interconnect, to see where performance of conventional parallel applications starts to deteriorate. We find that for gaps larger than those of current NUMAs (one order of magnitude) performance rapidly drops to an unacceptable level. For five out of six applications we describe performance improvements. (Since the applications were originally designed for a machine with a uniform interconnect, perhaps it should not be surprising that there is room for improvement.) The applications are quite diverse, and so are the algorithmic changes, though all have in common that the application’s communication pattern is made to fit the hierarchical interconnect — the changes do not improve performance on a uniform network. Commonalities between the improvements are described. For the improved applications, the impact of the same range of gaps in the interconnect is analyzed, to see how the changes influence application behavior, and how well they work. Taking 60% of the speedup under uniform remote access as our criterion, we find that, for bandwidth, the acceptable NUMA gap is increased to 2 orders of magnitude, and for latency it is increased to 3 orders of magnitude. We conclude that in many applications, with careful optimization there is room for growth to large architectures with highly non-uniform access times. The application improvements themselves are straightforward programming techniques — the challenge lies in understanding the interaction between interconnect and communication pattern. Further work is needed to make this easier, by expressing communication with higher level primitives, or by incorporating common traits of the improvements into coherency protocols. The experience with DSMs on SMP clusters suggests, however, that this will be challenging [30] . Gaps of 2–3 orders of magnitude correspond to differences between local area and wide area links. Most meta-computing projects currently use embarrassingly parallel (job-level) applications that barely communicate. Our results imply that the set of applications that can be run on large scale architectures, such as a computational grid, is larger than assumed so far, and includes medium grain applications. (Further research should study the impact of variations in latency and bandwidth, which often occur on wide area links.) The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Sections 3 and 4 describe in detail the applications, improvements, and system that have been used in this experiment. Section 5 describes the results of our measurements, and analyzes them. Section 6 outlines directions of ongoing work. Section 7 concludes the paper and discusses implications of this work. 2 Related work and background In this paper, we try to understand how large differences in bandwidths and latencies in an interconnect influence application performance. For small gaps, several studies report good performance on hardware DSM NUMA systems [10,19,24,32,33,40] . These systems have a gap of about a factor of 3 between the slowest and the fastest links. The picture changes for systems with longer access times. Papers by Cox et al. [11] , Kontothanassis et al. [22] , Lumetta et al. [25] , Scales et al. [30] , Stets et al. [35] , and Yeung et al. [41] study local area clusters of SMPs, which have a gap of up to an order of magnitude. These studies tend to focus on coherency protocol issues, using software DSMs such as MGS, TreadMarks, SoftFLASH, CashMere and Shasta, to see how the presence of hardware shared memory improves performance. Performance results vary; earlier studies using partial simulation or tightly coupled hardware [11,41] showed better results than studies using recent stock SMPs [12,22,25,30,35] . For SPLASH-like numerical applications, the experience with commercial SMPs is that the presence of hardware shared memory helps performance surprisingly little, due to bus contention and the cost of the hardware coherence protocol. Overall performance is somewhat disappointing, especially for applications that synchronize frequently. Soundararajan et al. [34] attempt to improve NUMA performance through better data locality, with migration/replication protocols. False sharing and disappointing performance in general is the reason for work on data structure and algorithm restructuring [17,18] . Jiang et al. [18] use a software DSM on top of a network of workstations. Even though here remote access times are uniform, the relatively large network overhead requires application changes for good performance. Their changes exceed simple padding or data-structure rearranging, requiring insight into both the application and key aspects of the SVM. In previous work we have experimented with a still larger gap, of 2 orders of magnitude, for which we also found that applications need communication pattern changes [3] . Wide area systems typically have gaps of 3–4 orders of magnitude, which covers the end of the range that we study here. Compared to SMP clusters, they provide a more challenging environment in terms of latency and bandwidth gap, but also of fault tolerance and heterogeneity. Meta-computing research focuses on the latter two issues [13,15] . Because of the high (and non-uniform) latencies, applications are typically embarrassingly parallel, unlike ours, which are of medium grain. As NUMA systems scale up, it is inevitable that memory access times become less uniform. There is evidence that applications can be quite sensitive to non-uniform memory access [3,18,34] , and we want to know how applications perform on such systems. So far, little attention has been paid to the effect of gap size. Previous studies use small, fixed, gaps. We are interested in how performance scales with different gaps; in our interconnect the gap is varied over a large range, from 0 to 4 orders of magnitude. In addition, many studies focus on issues such as DSM protocols or message passing versus shared memory [9,10,34] . Again, our focus is the NUMA gap. We investigate where conventional applications break down, how communication patterns can be adapted, and how far performance improvement can be pushed. As an important aside, we want to know how difficult it is to implement such changes. Differences in link speeds pose interesting challenges to programmers. This paper explores how serious these challenges are, and how we can deal with some of them. 3 Applications Our application suite consists of six diverse programs. Barnes-Hut, Water, and FFT are numerical programs that originate from the Splash-2 suite [40] , TSP and ASP are optimization codes, and Awari is a symbolic artificial intelligence program. The applications have diverse communication patterns. Table 1 summarizes the behavior of the applications on a single Myrinet cluster. For all applications, larger problems give better speedups. We use relatively small problem sizes in order to get medium grain communication. Medium grain is taken here as a total communication volume of at least 100 K Byte/s on a single level cluster of 32 processors. All applications and problem sizes run efficiently on a single Myrinet cluster. Five of our six applications are written in the Orca parallel programming language [2] , for ease of use of the wide area system, and for ease of debugging (Orca is type-safe). For most programs, serial performance is comparable to serial C performance. Barnes-Hut is written in C with calls to the Panda [2] wide area/local area messaging layer. 3.1 Application characteristics This section summarizes key application characteristics. The next subsection describes the improvements that were implemented to achieve good performance on the highly non-uniform system. Water : The Water program is based on the “ n 2 ” Water application from the Splash suite [40] , rewritten for distributed memory [29] . Related distributed memory optimizations are described by Jiang et al. [18] . We report on experiments with a medium sized input set of 1500 particles. The serial speed of the distributed memory program is about 10% better than the original Splash code. Barnes-Hut : Barnes-Hut is an O (n log n) N -body simulation. The implementation in the Splash-2 suite has a fine coherency unit which causes inefficiencies on coarse grain hardware [2,18] . In this experiment a new distributed-memory code by Blackston and Suel [5] has been used. Instead of finding out at runtime which nodes and bodies are needed to compute an interaction, this code pre-computes where nodes and bodies are needed, and sends them in one collective communication phase at the start of each iteration. Stalls in the computation phase are thus eliminated. Related improvements have been reported by Grama et al. [14] , Jiang et al. [18] , and Warren and Salmon [39] . Using the same input problem, the serial program runs slightly faster than the Splash code (while computing the same answer). We used a set of 64K particles. ASP : The All-pairs Shortest Path program is a parallel version of the classic Floyd–Warshall algorithm. It uses a replicated distance matrix of 1500×1500 entries. Each processor iterates over rows in the matrix, and broadcasts resulting rows as they are computed. These have to be processed in order by the other processors before they can compute their rows. A designated node issues sequence numbers to achieve this ordering. TSP : The Traveling Salesperson Problem computes the length of the shortest path along n cities, by enumerating the possible paths. The program uses a centralized job queue which is filled with partial paths, from which workers get jobs. A 16 city problem is used as input; jobs consist of a partial tour of five cities, creating small jobs and a (for this application) fine communication grain, as Table 1 shows. Deterministic runs are ensured by using a fixed cutoff bound [2] . Awari : Awari, a retrograde analysis program, is a symbolic application that computes end game databases, of importance for programs playing games such as checkers. It is based on backwards reasoning and bottom-up search. Here, we compute a relatively small 9 stone database for the African board game Awari. The program sends many small, asynchronous packets of work to other processors [1] . These messages are combined into larger messages for performance reasons. The communication pattern of Awari is irregular asynchronous point-to-point messages. FFT : The FFT application computes a one-dimensional Fast Fourier transform, using the transpose algorithm [23] . The program is a rewrite of the Splash-2 code for distributed memory, and achieves an excellent speedup on a single Myrinet cluster, despite the short runtime. The communication part of this program is very simple: it performs three transposes, interspersed by parallel FFTs. The problem size is 2 20 complex floating point numbers, the largest that would fit in memory. FFT shows a small superlinear speedup, due to cache effects. Table 2 summarizes the communication patterns and improvements. Fig. 1 summarizes inter-cluster traffic of the original applications. The figures show data volumes in megabytes per second per cluster and number of messages per second per cluster (for 6 M Byte/s bandwidth per link and 0.5 ms latency, and 4 clusters of 8 processors, a configuration with 12 wide area links in total). TSP has an extremely low inter-cluster communication volume, 0.1 M Byte/s, though a non-negligible number of messages. Barnes-Hut and FFT have a high communication volume of nearly 7 M Byte/s (note that the bandwidth limit in this case is 18 M Byte/s per cluster, since with 4 clusters there are 3 links of 6 M Byte/s out of each cluster). Awari can be found in the opposite corner of the graph, with a high number of tiny inter-cluster messages (more than 4000 per second per cluster). Water and ASP have a modest level of inter-cluster traffic, less than 1000 messages per second and less than 2 M Byte/s per cluster. 3.2 Optimizations per application The applications are run on an interconnect whose bandwidth and latency difference ranges from small to large. The system consists of 4 clusters of 8 processors each. Inside the clusters the processors are connected by fast Myrinet links (0.020 ms application level latency, 50 M Byte/s application level bandwidth). The clusters themselves are fully connected by slow ATM links through additional gateway machines (0.4–300 ms latency, 10–0.03 M Byte/s bandwidth). Thus, we have a two level interconnect. The applications have been originally developed with a uniform network in mind, where all links have the same latency and bandwidth. Performance suffers when the system is highly non-uniform, as in our system, where slow links have latencies up to 5000 times the latency of fast links. This section describes which problems have to be resolved to achieve good performance. Some of the improvements have been described previously in [3] . Water : The Water program is a classical simulation program of the behavior of n water molecules in an imaginary box. Each of the p processors is assigned an equal number of water molecules. The computation of the O( n 2 ) inter-molecular forces is the most time-consuming part of the simulation. Forces between two molecules are computed by one of the two processors, the owner of that molecule. At the start of this phase, each processor gets the positions of the molecules of half of the other processors. As a force is calculated it is added locally to determine the total force acting on the local molecule, and is sent to the appropriate other processor so that it can compute the total force for its molecule. All individual molecule updates destined for a processor are combined into one message. The force update phase amounts to two “all-to-half” communications (one to distribute molecule positions, one to send force updates back). The total number of messages approximates p( 1 2 p)= O (p 2 ) . The Water program suffers from a severe performance degradation when inter-cluster links are much slower than intra-cluster links. With 4 clusters, 75% of all messages are between clusters, that is, slow. The two operations, copying of molecule positions and adding of force updates, are 1− n and n −1, reduction-like, operations. With the original program, the position of a given molecule is transferred many times over the same inter-cluster link, since multiple processors in a cluster need it. The optimization avoids sending the same data over the inter-cluster link more than once. For every processor p in a remote cluster, we designate one of the processors in the local cluster as the local coordinator for p . If a process needs the molecule data of processor p , it does an intra-cluster RPC to the local coordinator of p . The coordinator gets the data over the inter-cluster link, forwards it to the requester, and also caches it locally. If other processors in the cluster ask for the same data, they are sent the cached copy. A similar optimization is used at the end of the iteration for the force updates. All updates are first sent to the local coordinator, which does a reduction operation (addition) on the data and transfers only the result over the inter-cluster link. Barnes-Hut : Blackston and Suel’s distributed version of the Barnes-Hut algorithm pre-computes where nodes and bodies will be needed in each iteration, and sends them in one collective communication phase at the start of the iteration. The program is coded in Valiant’s BSP style [37] . Communication takes place in so-called supersteps, which are separated by barriers. In each of these supersteps the program sends many small messages, which incur large overhead if sent indiscriminately over inter-cluster links. All efficient BSP implementations perform message combining of small messages for each recipient. To achieve good performance on the multi-cluster, two more optimizations have been implemented. First, each sender processor combines messages to different recipients in the same target cluster into one message towards the target cluster gateway, using the fact that the code pre-computes which parts of the Barnes-Hut tree will be needed on other processors. These messages are dispatched by the receiving cluster gateway to the recipients. Second, the strict barrier synchronization is relaxed by using explicit sequence numbers. (BSP is a relatively young programming model. An active community exists working on efficient implementations of the model, see, for example [36] .) ASP : In ASP, processors iterate over rows in a distance matrix, generating resulting rows that are needed by the other processors before they can start new iterations. In the original implementation, a designated sequencer node is used to ensure that rows arrive in order at the processors. The sender of the row has to wait for a sequence number to arrive before it can continue. On a multi-cluster with 4 clusters, 75% of the broadcast requests will thus incur the inter-cluster penalty. This slows down the program significantly. Communication in ASP is quite regular: first processor 1 computes and broadcasts its rows, then processor 2, etc. On the multi-cluster we take advantage of this regularity by migrating the sequencer to the cluster of the node that does the sending. In this way, sequencer requests can be satisfied by a node in the local cluster. In a four cluster system, the sequencer has to migrate only three times, incurring inter-cluster latency only three times. (Another solution would be to drop the sequencer altogether, since processors know who will send which row. Again, this solution exploits the regularity of the ASP algorithm.) The row broadcasts themselves are asynchronous, so the sender does not suffer from inter-cluster latency. Overall progress is, however, sensitive to inter-cluster bandwidth. Broadcasts are performed using a multicast tree, with point-to-point communication from the sender to the cluster gateways, and multi-cast primitives inside clusters. TSP : TSP uses a single job queue from which processors retrieve work when their current job is finished. On 4 clusters, 75% of the traffic is between clusters. Even though, compared to the other applications, TSP communicates infrequently, the level of traffic still limits performance considerably. The centralized job queue causes too much inter-cluster traffic. The multi-cluster optimization is to distribute the queue over the clusters. Each cluster now has its own queue, and workers perform work stealing only from their own queue. When the queue becomes empty it tries to steal work from the other cluster queues, to maintain a good load balance. In our system, the number of clusters is small compared to the number of processors. There are only as many queues as there are clusters, and inter-cluster traffic is solely influenced by the number of clusters, not by the number of processors per cluster. Awari : Awari performs a parallel search starting from known end states in a search space (for example, checkmate). States are hashed to processors. The values of all reachable states are computed and sent to the processors owning these positions, which start working on them by generating known values of their reachable states. This process results in many small messages. The original parallel program performs message combining for destination processors, to reduce communication overhead. The search progresses in stages; in each stage, the database for one more stone is computed. Too much message combining results in load imbalance since processors are starved of work at the end of the stages. The high volume of small messages combined with the larger overhead of the inter-cluster links limits performance. To reduce the impact of this overhead, we add another layer of message combining: cross-cluster messages are first being assembled at a designated local processor, are then sent in batches over the slow link, and are subsequently distributed by a designated processor at the other cluster to the final destinations. The extra layer of message combining reduces the impact of the large communication overhead of the inter-cluster links. FFT : The FFT application is renowned for its high communication volume. It is especially ill-suited for a system with long latencies and low bandwidths, or a highly non-uniform interconnect. The communication pattern is a matrix transpose, with little computation. No multi-cluster optimization was found. The purpose of this work is to gain insight in the limits of multi-layer systems with a highly non-uniform architecture. FFT serves as a reminder that there are programs that are unsuited for our interconnects. 3.3 Optimization overview Despite the small input problems, all applications except Awari perform well on a single Myrinet cluster ( Table 1 ). Table 2 lists for each program the base communication pattern and its improvement. The main goal of the improvements is to match the communication structure of the application with the hierarchical interconnect; applications should reduce their communication over slow links — or at least reduce their dependency on that communication. Like the programs, the communication patterns are quite diverse; the optimizations also appear to be quite varied. The general strategy in optimizing for highly non-uniform interconnects is to change the algorithm so that less traffic is sent over the slow links. If that is not possible, then we trade-off latency sensitivity at the cost of increased bandwidth requirements. Four types of optimizable communication patterns can be distinguished in our applications; two are of a more algorithmic nature, and two are more related to communication parameters. The first optimization is the reduction operation, which was implemented in Water as a one-level tree. For the multi-cluster interconnect, it is implemented with a two-level tree, the cluster gateways accumulating intermediate results. The second optimization is the work queue, which is implemented in TSP as a single centralized queue. For the multi-cluster interconnect, it is implemented as a distributed queue, one queue per cluster gateway with work stealing among the clusters to maintain load balance. The third optimization is message combining, which is used in Barnes-Hut and Awari to reduce communication overhead for frequent small messages on high-overhead links. The fourth optimization is to exploit asynchrony inherent in the application, which is used in ASP to reduce the number of synchronization points. Furthermore, it can be argued that Blackston and Suel have performed just this kind of optimization in their rewrite of a traditional Splash-like shared memory Barnes-Hut code. The communication pattern of FFT is too synchronous and fine grained; no optimization was found. It is interesting to contrast our changes to the restructuring by Jiang et al. [18] . Their work is performed on a software DSM running on a network of workstations, a system with uniform remote access links. They focus on restructuring algorithms to reduce overheads caused by inefficient remote access patterns, fine-grain synchronization, and multiple-writer algorithms. Our system has non-uniform remote access links; we focus on restructuring communication patterns in a two-level system, reducing traffic over the slow links by clustered work stealing, message combining, removing synchronization points, and optimizing reduction operations. Our changes differ from Jiang’s in that we make explicit use of the multi-level structure of the interconnect. Indeed, the changes are ineffective on an interconnect with uniform remote access links. The algorithmic changes are applications of well-known techniques. The novelty lies not so much in the changes themselves as in the magnitude of the performance improvement they cause. The hard part is the understanding of the application behavior, and how it maps to the interconnect (see also [3,18] ). Efforts to express communication constructs on a higher conceptual level [7,8,27,31] , or to incorporate them in a cache coherency protocol, would ease this problem (Soundararajan et al. [34] describe work on protocol optimizations for a NUMA gap of one order of magnitude). The next section continues with the performance analysis of our applications. 4 Experimental set-up We use an experimental cluster-of-clusters system called DAS, shown in Fig. 2 . The DAS consists of four local clusters of 200 MHz/128 MB Pentium Pro machines connected by Myrinet [6] , using LANai 4.1 interfaces. The peak bandwidth of Myrinet is 2.4 Gbit/s, and host-to-host latency is at least 5 μs . In our system, application-level bandwidth is 50 M Byte/s, one-way application level latency is 20 μs . The clusters are located at four universities in the Netherlands. They are connected via dedicated gateway machines over ATM by 6 Mbit/s Permanent Virtual Circuits (application-level bandwidth is 0.55 M Byte/s over TCP). The round trip latency is 2.5–3 ms. Three sites have 24 compute nodes, each one site has 128. The wide area network is fully connected, the system-area networks are two-dimensional meshes. The operating system is BSD/OS Version 3 from BSDI. The wide area ATM links have a fixed latency and bandwidth. To allow for experimentation with different speeds, 8 local ATM links have been installed in the 128 processor cluster, using the same hardware as in the real wide area system (ForeRunner PCA-200E ATM boards). The latency and bandwidth of the ATM links can be varied by delay loops in the cluster gateway machines. Except for the local ATM links, this experimentation system is identical to the real wide area system; the same binaries are run in both set-ups, and except for the delay loops, there are no simulated parts. When the delay loops are set to the wide area latency and bandwidth, runtimes differ on average by 3.6% for our applications. All runs in this experimentation system showed very reproducible timings, except for Barnes-Hut, whose timings spread more than a factor of two over the runs. Since we suspect the TCP stack of causing this behavior, Barnes-Hut was run on a modified experimentation system where the ATM/TCP links were replaced by Myrinet links. The delay loops for this pure Myrinet system were calibrated to produce exactly the same behavior as the ATM/TCP system. On the pure Myrinet system, the timing anomalies disappeared. Therefore we present the performance on the pure Myrinet system for Barnes-Hut. The system can be programmed through different libraries and languages, from message passing libraries such as MPI and Panda [2] , software DSMs such as TreadMarks and CRL [20] , to parallel languages such as Orca [2] and Java [26] . The Panda messaging layer has been adapted to support communication over both Myrinet (using Illinois Fast Messages [28] or the LFC Myrinet control program [4] ) and ATM (using BSD’s TCP/IP). 5 Results The goal of this work is charting the sensitivity of application performance to gaps in bandwidth and latency. This section discusses the performance measurements. The speedup of a multi-cluster machine is bounded by the speedup of a single-cluster machine with the same number of processors, and the same execution schedule. (To put this differently, when some of the fast Myrinet links of the interconnect are changed into slow ATM links, our parallel applications will run more slowly.) Speedups are shown relative to the all-Myrinet upper bound. 5.1 Relative speedup Fig. 3 shows speedup graphs for the six applications, for 4 clusters of 8 processors: unoptimized on the first and third row, optimized on the second and fourth row. Speedup is shown relative to the speedup of the 32 processor all-Myrinet cluster, for different inter-cluster bandwidths and latencies. It is computed as percentage T L / T M , where T L is the runtime on the single cluster and T M the runtime on the multi-cluster. Startup phases are omitted from time and traffic measurements. Myrinet bandwidth is constant at 50 M Byte/s, latency is constant at 20 μs . Inter-cluster bandwidth and latency are limited by the local OC3 ATM link of 155 Mbit/s — at the application level, over TCP, this yields 14 M Byte/s bandwidth and 0.28 ms latency. On the x -axis the bandwidth of the ATM links is shown. Delays are set so that the resulting bandwidth is 6.3, 2.6, 0.95, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.03 M Byte/s. The one-way ATM latency is set to 0.4, 1.3, 3.3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 ms. The speedup profiles render performance relative to all-Myrinet speedup for latency/bandwidth combinations. The general shape of the graphs is as can be expected: higher inter-cluster bandwidth and lower inter-cluster latency improve performance, and multi-cluster performance is lower than single-cluster Myrinet performance. When we compare the optimized to the unoptimized graphs, the optimizations result in the graphs being shifted upward or to the left. An upward shift indicates higher performance for the same inter-cluster latency. A shift to the left indicates that the same performance can be achieved at lower inter-cluster bandwidth. (In most applications both effects can be seen.) For Water, the optimizations extend the range of bandwidth where speedup is better than 60% of all-Myrinet from 1 to 0.1 M Byte/s. For the original program, performance decreases steadily from 10 ms latency or 1 M Byte/s bandwidth; the performance of the optimized program is much more stable, and deteriorates seriously from 100 ms latency or 0.03 M Byte/s. Overall, the NUMA gap for which good performance is achieved is improved by more than an order of magnitude for both inter-cluster latency and bandwidth. For the fastest inter-cluster links, however, the unoptimized program is faster: here, the increase in local communication is not (yet) outweighed by the reduction in remote communication. For Barnes-Hut the improvements have a similar effect, although overall performance is not as good. For Awari the message combining has more than doubled performance for latency up to 3.3 ms; the higher overheads can be masked by message combining, provided that there is enough bandwidth. The improved version of ASP has a good performance for up to 30 ms latency, against 1 ms for the original program. Speedup shows a sharp sensitivity to bandwidth below 1 M Byte/s, as explained in Section 3.2 . TSP, on the other hand, is practically insensitive to bandwidth but is sensitive to latency. Its performance is increased by about 25% by the improvements. For high bandwidth/low latency combinations, performance is good for the improved versions of four of the applications, Barnes-Hut, Water, ASP, and TSP. For inter-cluster latencies of 0.5–3.3 ms and bandwidths of 0.3–6 M Byte/s multi-cluster speedup is well above 50% of single-cluster speedup. For bandwidths better than 1 M Byte/s speedup reaches 60% for 30 ms latency, and about 40% for 100 ms latency. For extreme bandwidths and latencies (30 K Byte/s bandwidth or 300 ms latency) relative speedup drops below 25%, which corresponds to the performance of a single Myrinet cluster of 8 processors. Thus, for these bandwidths and latencies, using extra clusters actually slows down the computation. Performance for Awari and FFT is significantly lower. For FFT the 25% point is not even reached. The reason for the bad performance of Awari and FFT is that these applications have a higher level of inter-cluster communication. In Awari the extra level of message combining is moderately effective; too much message combining introduces load imbalance. In FFT no optimization has been implemented. To summarize, for Barnes-Hut, Water, ASP, and TSP, the range for inter-cluster bandwidth and latency at which reasonable speedups are achieved is increased by an order of magnitude or more by the restructuring of the communication pattern. Reasonable speedup starts at an inter-cluster bandwidth of 0.1–0.3 M Byte/s and an inter-cluster latency of 30–100 ms. Given a Myrinet bandwidth of 50 M Byte/s and a latency of 20 μs , this corresponds to an intra/inter-cluster performance gap of 167–500 for bandwidth and 1500–5000 for latency, depending on whether 40 or 60% of single-cluster speedup is desired. The optimized applications allow a significantly larger gap for latency than for bandwidth. In addition to the sensitivity to bandwidth and latency gaps, we have also performed experiments with different cluster structures. Performance increases as there are more, smaller, clusters: a set-up of 8 clusters of 4 processors outperforms 4 clusters of 8 processors. This may seem counter-intuitive, since replacing fast links with slow links ought to reduce performance. However, performance is limited by wide area bandwidth, and our wide area network is fully connected: in the multi-cluster, bisection bandwidth actually increases as more slow links are added, despite the loss of fast links. This effect can be traced to simple bandwidth sensitivity: speedup decreases as more processors compete for the same wide area links. (Graphs show a straightforward effect, and are omitted for reasons of space.) In a larger system it is likely that the topology is less perfect. This effect will then diminish, and disappear in star, ring, or bus topologies. Future topologies will in practice be somewhere in between the worst case of a star or ring and the best case of a fully connected network. 5.2 Bandwidth and latency sensitivity This section analyzes the inter-cluster traffic in more detail, to complement the speedup picture. We focus on synchronous versus asynchronous communication by examining inter-cluster communication for different bandwidths and latencies. Performance is influenced strongly by inter-cluster traffic (high-traffic applications have a low speedup and vice versa). The speed of the interconnect influences communication and synchronization overhead of the programs. The left-hand side graph in Fig. 4 shows the percentage of runtime that is spent in communication over the inter-cluster interconnect as a function of bandwidth, for 4 clusters of size 8; one-way latency is set to 3.3 ms. The right-hand side graph in Fig. 4 shows the inter-cluster communication time of the interconnect as a function of latency; bandwidth is set to 0.9 M Byte/s. The communication time percentage is computed as ( T M − T L )/ T M ×100, or the difference between multi-cluster runtime and single cluster runtime as a percentage of multi-cluster runtime. These graphs represent no new data compared to Section 5.1 , but they offer a different viewpoint to increase understanding of communication behavior. These graphs indicate where applications are dominated by synchronous communication, and where by asynchronous communication. Purely asynchronous communication is limited by bandwidth (if we disregard startup time); it corresponds to a horizontal line in the latency graph. Purely synchronous communication (i.e., a null-RPC) is limited by latency; it corresponds to a horizontal line in the bandwidth graph. The graphs in Fig. 4 show that the communication patterns of the applications contain both streaming of asynchronous communication and request/reply style synchronous communication. It is interesting to note the differences among the applications. In both the bandwidth and the latency graph, communication time for FFT is close to 100%, indicating that runtime is almost completely dominated by communication. Awari is a close second, although at latencies lower than 10 ms communication time drops sharply (at 3 M Byte/s). For Barnes-Hut, Water, ASP and TSP communication time is significantly less at high bandwidth and low latency. Latency : Up to 3 ms Barnes-Hut, Water, and ASP are relatively insensitive to latency; their lines are nearly flat. For longer latencies, communication becomes quite sensitive to latency. Apparently, up to 3 ms the data dependencies of the programs allow latency hiding. TSP is quite independent of bandwidth for latencies up to 10 ms. Bandwidth : For a bandwidth of 10–3 M Byte/s, Barnes-Hut, Water, Awari, and ASP are relatively insensitive to bandwidth. TSP is almost completely insensitive to bandwidth; its work-stealing communication pattern comes quite close to the null-RPC. 6 Further work Encouraged by these results, we have sought to package the wide area optimizations in a way that is transparent for the application programmer, to make programming wide area parallel applications easier. One of the types of optimizations involved collective operations (see Section 3.3 ). The MPI message passing interface defines 14 collective communication operations (in addition to the standard point-to-point send and receive). Examples of these operations are broadcast, barrier, and reduce. For these 14 collective operations, we have implemented algorithms that are designed to take advantage of the two-level nature of our wide area interconnect. The algorithms make sure that data items destined for another cluster are sent only once over the slow wide area links; the completion time of a collective operation is on the order of one wide area latency. We have performed some early measurements with this system. On moderate cluster sizes, using wide area latency of 10 ms and a bandwidth of 1 M Byte/s, the system executes operations up to 10 times faster than MPICH [16] , a widely used MPI implementation. Application kernels improve by up to a factor of 4. Due to the structure of our algorithms, the system’s advantage increases for higher wide area latencies. Our implementation is implemented as a plug-in library for MPICH, and is called MagPIe, in honor of the bird that collects things. With MagPIe, MPI programs can use collective operations efficiently and transparently on a hierarchical interconnect. Not a single line of application code has to be changed to use the MagPIe algorithms. The system is described more fully in [21] . Simultaneously, we are currently trying to identify and package wide area optimizations for parallel Java programs. Early application experience has been reported in [38] . 7 Conclusions Current NUMA machines yield good performance for many applications [19] ; however, there is little insight in application performance on interconnects with a larger gap between slow and fast link speed. Such a large gap will occur in large-scale NUMAs, or when, as in a meta-computer, wide area links are added to the interconnect. As far as we know, this is the first study to examine performance of non-trivial applications over a large range of gaps, using a real system. Our main contribution is an analysis of when the difference between slow and fast links starts to affect performance. We describe ways to restructure the applications to make performance less sensitive to a large gap, and we analyze how well the improvements work. We do this by examining speedup relative to the gap in bandwidth and latency in the interconnect. We find that when the difference in speed in an interconnect grows larger than in current generation NUMAs, performance suffers dramatically. For these gaps (one order of magnitude and larger) communication becomes limited by the slow links in the interconnect. Once the bottleneck is identified, we can apply changes such as increasing the height of reduction trees, clustering work stealing, combining messages, and removing redundant synchronization points — changes that make explicit use of the multi-level structure of the interconnect, in contrast to the work by Jiang et al. [18] , who describe single-level changes. The changes can speedup applications significantly. When acceptable performance is defined as 60% of the speedup on a uniform interconnect, restructuring the communication pattern increases the allowable gap in bandwidth and latency by more than an order of magnitude: in our system gaps of 2 orders of magnitude for bandwidth, and 3 orders of magnitude for latency, can be bridged by four of our six applications. However, some communication patterns, such as matrix transpose, resist optimization. Interconnects are becoming increasingly hierarchical, making it harder to achieve high performance. Nevertheless, we believe that for many real applications it will remain possible to do so. We also believe that to achieve this level of performance, more effort is needed to assist programmers in identifying performance problems, to help them better to understand the characteristics of interconnect and program. We have mentioned our experience with Java and MagPIe, an augmentation of MPI, in this respect.

We use the new model of computation introduced by L. Blum, M. Shub and S. Smale that accepts as inputs vectors of real numbers and allows the transfer of the stuctural approach to computability and complexity for computations with real numbers. More concretely, we give a proof of the existence of NP(R)-complete problems. Also, we introduce a new complexity class PAT(R) which describes the complexity of the decision of quantified formulae and, in order to study its relationships with the already existing complexity classes, a model for parallel computations is also introduced. Using the classes resulting by bounding resources in this parallel model, some separation results are finally obtained. In particular, we show that the polynomial hierarchy over the reals is strictly contained in PAT(R).'}

4177	417733	Software control systems for parallel simulation	{'title': 'Software control systems for parallel simulation', 'text': 'Parallel simulations using optimistic synchronization strategies such as Time Warp, operate with no regard to global synchronization since this results in greater parallelism and lower synchronization cost. However, like virtual memory, the parallel simulators may end up thrashing instead of performing useful work. The complication in using a Time Warp simulator is then to configure it suitably for good performance and avoid thrashing. Unfortunately, the optimal configuration is not generally static among different applications or even throughout an entire run of a single application. Thus, online feedback control systems are deployed to govern the adjustment of input parameters in our Time Warp simulation kernel. The design and implementation of effective feedback control systems can be difficult; the extra processing is pure overhead that must be absorbed by any performance gains delivered. The problem is further complicated when attempting to build a simulation kernel that is designed efficiently to operate with many different applications. In this paper, we introduce a control-centric architecture that is used to monitor and manage different parts of a Time Warp simulator. Specifically, we extend concepts from control theory such as adaptive control and stability, to better understand and design hierarchically-distributed run-time control systems for Time Warp based parallel simulation.'}
4177	417746	Lock-free pending event set management in time warp	{'title': 'Lock-free pending event set management in time warp', 'text': 'The rapid growth in the parallelism of multi-core processors has opened up new opportunities and challenges for parallel simulation discrete event simulation (PDES). PDES simulators attempt to find parallelism within the pending event set to achieve speedup. Typically the pending event set is sorted to preserve the causal orders of the contained events. Sorting is a key aspect that amplifies contention for exclusive access to the shared event scheduler and events are generally scheduled to follow the time-based order of the pending events. In this work we leverage a Ladder Queue data structure to partition the pending events into groups (called buckets) arranged by adjacent and short regions of time. We assume that the pending events within any one bucket are causally independent and schedule them for execution without sorting and without consideration of their total time-based order. We use the Time Warp mechanism to recover whenever actual dependencies arise. Due to the lack of need for sorting, we further extend our pending event data structure so that it can be organized for lock-free access. Experimental results show consistent speedup for all studied configurations and simulation models. The speedups range from 1.1 to 1.49 with higher speedups occurring with higher thread counts where contention for the shared event set becomes more problematic with a conventional mutex locking mechanism.'}
4178	417870	Generalized Posynomial Performance Modeling	The content discusses a study that found a positive correlation between the amount of time people spend in nature and their overall well-being. The study surveyed over 20,000 people and found that those who spent at least 120 minutes per week in nature reported higher levels of physical and mental well-being compared to those who spent less time in nature. The benefits of spending time in nature include reduced stress, improved mood, and increased physical activity. The study suggests that incorporating regular nature exposure into daily life can have significant positive effects on overall well-being.

Due to limited number of control pins and routing resources, additional Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing layers may be required which potentially raises the fabrication cost. Previous state-of-the-art work has tried to develop a framework that uses a network-flow-based method for broadcast electrodeaddressing EWOD biochips. Nevertheless, greedily merging of electrical pins in previous works is at high risk of producing unroutable design. Routability should have higher priority than pin reduction. While previous works dedicated their effort on pin reduction, we have addressed our attention on routability of broadcast addressing. Experimental results demonstrate that taking routability into consideration can even have higher pin reduction. Viewed in this light, we present ACER, a routability driven clustering algorithm followed by escape routing using integer linear programming that effectively solves both pin merging and routing in broadcast addressing framework. Our proposed algorithm does not greedily focus on pin-reduction. Instead, routability is taken into consideration through agglomerative clustering. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, our proposed algorithm can further reduce required control pins by an average of 13% and route the design using 68% less wirelength.'}

In order to simultaneously handle chip and package performances, co-design of chip and package is a widely adopted solution, particularly because the finger/pad locations significantly affect IR-drop of the core and the package routing. In this paper, we develop chip-package co-design techniques to determine the locations of the fingers/pads for package routability and signal integrity concerns in IC designs, this method can be used in the 2-D and stacking IC design. Our finger/pad assignment is a two-step method: we first solve the wire congestion problem in package routing, and then try to minimize the IR-drop violation and the length of the bonding wires under a compact IR-drop model. The experimental results are encouraging. Compared with the randomly optimized method, on average, our approaches reduce the maximum package density by 42% and 68% for both technologies, IR-drop by 10.61% and 4.58%; and the bonding wires is reduced by 15.66% if we use stacking chips.'}

Opinion and topic diversity in the output sets can provide individual and societal benefits, but simply selecting the most popular items may not yield as much di- versity as is present in the overall pool of votes and links. In this paper, we define three diversity metrics that ad- dress different dimensions of diversity: inclusion, non- alienation, and proportional representation. We then present the Sidelines algorithm - which temporarily suppresses a voter's preferences after a preferred item has been selected - as one approach to increase the diversity of result sets. In comparison to collections of the most popular items, from user votes on Digg.com and links from a panel of political blogs, the Sidelines algorithm increased inclusion while de- creasing alienation. For the blog links, a set with known po- litical preferences, we also found that Sidelines improved proportional representation. In an online experiment using blog link data as votes, readers were more likely to find something challenging to their views in the Sidelines result sets. These findings can help build news and opinion aggre- gators that present users with a broader range of topics and opinions."}

We compare two ILP systems, FOIL and FLIPPER, and conclude that FLIPPER generally outperforms FOIL on this problem. We analyze the reasons for the differing performance of these two systems, and based on the analysis, propose two extensions to FLIPPER: a user-directed bias towards easy-to-evaluate clauses, and an extension that allows FLIPPER to learn "counting clauses". Counting clauses augment logic programs with a variation of the "number restrictions" used in description logics, and significantly improve performance on this problem when prior knowledge is used. We also evaluate the use of ILP techniques for automatic generation of Boolean indicators and numeric metrics from the calling tree representation.'}

One scalability problem shared by many probabilistic logics is that answering queries involves "grounding" the query---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation---and the size of a "grounding" grows with database size. To address this bottleneck, we present a first-order probabilistic language called ProPPR in which that approximate "local groundings" can be constructed in time independent of database size. Technically, ProPPR is an extension to stochastic logic programs (SLPs) that is biased towards short derivations; it is also closely related to an earlier relational learning algorithm called the path ranking algorithm (PRA). We show that the problem of constructing proofs for this logic is related to computation of personalized PageRank (PPR) on a linearized version of the proof space, and using on this connection, we develop a proveably-correct approximate grounding scheme, based on the PageRank-Nibble algorithm. Building on this, we develop a fast and easily-parallelized weight-learning algorithm for ProPPR. In experiments, we show that learning for ProPPR is orders magnitude faster than learning for Markov logic networks; that allowing mutual recursion (joint learning) in KB inference leads to improvements in performance; and that ProPPR can learn weights for a mutually recursive program with hundreds of clauses, which define scores of interrelated predicates, over a KB containing one million entities.

A number of dynamic programming algorithms such as Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and Policy Search by Dynamic Programming (PSDP), can efficiently compute non-stationary policies for these tasks --- such policies in general are well-suited to trajectory following since they can easily generate different control actions at different times in order to follow the trajectory. However, a weakness of these algorithms is that their policies are time-indexed, in that they apply different policies depending on the current time. This is problematic since 1) the current time may not correspond well to where we are along the trajectory and 2) the uncertainty over states can prevent these algorithms from finding any good policies at all. In this paper we propose a method for space-indexed dynamic programming that overcomes both these difficulties. We begin by showing how a dynamical system can be rewritten in terms of a spatial index variable (i.e., how far along the trajectory we are) rather than as a function of time. We then use these space-indexed dynamical systems to derive space-indexed version of the DDP and PSDP algorithms. Finally, we show that these algorithms perform well on a variety of control tasks, both in simulation and on real systems.'}

The Bayesian approach to model-based RL offers an elegant solution to this problem, by considering a distribution over possible models and acting to maximize expected reward; unfortunately, the Bayesian solution is intractable for all but very restricted cases. In this paper we present a simple algorithm, and prove that with high probability it is able to perform ε-close to the true (intractable) optimal Bayesian policy after some small (polynomial in quantities describing the system) number of time steps. The algorithm and analysis are motivated by the so-called PAC-MDP approach, and extend such results into the setting of Bayesian RL. In this setting, we show that we can achieve lower sample complexity bounds than existing algorithms, while using an exploration strategy that is much greedier than the (extremely cautious) exploration of PAC-MDP algorithms.'}

Graphs produced using such operations are of finite degree and automatic over the unary alphabet (that is, they can be described by finite automata over the unary alphabet). We investigate algorithmic properties of such unfolded graphs given their finite presentations. In particular, we ask whether a given node belongs to an infinite component, whether two given nodes in the graph are reachable from one another and whether the graph is connected. We give polynomial-time algorithms for each of these questions. For a fixed input graph, the algorithm for the first question is in constant time and the second question is decided using an automaton that recognises the reachability relation in a uniform way. Hence, we improve on previous work, in which non-elementary or non-uniform algorithms were found.'}

Hence the problem whether a given regular tree language can be ordered by a scattered linear order or a well-order is decidable. Moreover, sharp bounds for tree-automatic well-orders on some regular tree languages are computed by connecting tree automata with automata on ordinals. The proofs use elementary techniques of automata theory.'}

4185	418585	On Hallucinating Context and Background Pixels from a Face Mask using Multi-scale GANs	{'title': 'On Hallucinating Context and Background Pixels from a Face Mask using Multi-scale GANs', 'text': 'We propose a multi-scale GAN model to hallucinate realistic context (forehead, hair, neck, clothes) and background pixels automatically from a single input face mask, without any user supervision. Instead of swapping a face on to an existing picture, our model directly generates realistic context and background pixels based on the features of the provided face mask. Unlike facial inpainting algorithms, it can generate realistic hallucinations even for a large number of missing pixels. Our model is composed of a cascaded network of GAN blocks, each tasked with hallucination of missing pixels at a particular resolution while guiding the synthesis process of the next GAN block. The hallucinated full face image is made photo-realistic by using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial and identity preserving losses at each block of the network. With a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in hallucinating context and background pixels from face masks varying in facial pose, expression and lighting, collected from multiple datasets subject disjoint with our training data. We also compare our method with popular face inpainting and face swapping models in terms of visual quality, realism and identity preservation. Additionally, we analyze our cascaded pipeline and compare it with the progressive growing of GANs, and explore its usage as a data augmentation module for training CNNs.'}

Typical face extraction algorithms make use of the locations of facial features, such as the center of eyes, that are marked either manually or automatically. It is not guaranteed, however, that we always obtain the exact or optimal locations of the eye centers, and using inaccurate landmark locations, and consequently poorly registered faces, is one of the main causes of performance degradation in appearance-based face recognition. Moreover, in some applications, it is hard to verify the correctness of the face extraction for every query image. For improved performance and robustness to the eye location variation, we propose an eye perturbation approach that generates multiple face extractions from a query image by using the perturbed eye locations centered at the initial eye locations. The extracted faces are then matched against the enrolled gallery set to produce individual similarity scores. Final decisions can be made by using various committee methods – nearest neighbor, maximum vote, etc. – of combining the results of individual classifiers. We conclude that the proposed eye perturbation approach with nearest neighbor classification improves recognition performance and makes existing face recognition algorithms robust to eye localization errors.'}

While quantifying network reachability within one administrative domain is a difficult problem in itself, performing the same computation across a network spanning multiple administrative domains presents a novel challenge. The problem of quantifying network reachability across multiple administrative domains is more difficult because the privacy of security policies of individual domains is a serious concern and needs to be protected through this process. In this paper, we propose the first cross-domain privacy-preserving protocol for quantifying network reachability. Our protocol constructs equivalent representations of the Access Control List (ACL) rules and determines network reachability while preserving the privacy of the individual ACLs. This protocol can accurately determine the network reachability along a network path through different administrative domains. We have implemented and evaluated our protocol on both real and synthetic ACLs.

However, proposed schemes do not provide mechanisms for key revocation and key renewal. In this paper, we propose the first key revocation and key renewal mechanisms for IBC schemes that are especially designed for MANETs. In our fully self-organized revocation scheme, each node monitors nodes in communication range and securely propagates its observations. The public key of a node is revoked if a minimum number of nodes accused the node. To enable key renewal, we introduce a modified format for ID-based public keys, such that new keys can be issued for the same identity. The introduced revocation scheme is efficient because it uses pre-shared keys from the Weil pairing and messages are sent to an m-hop neighborhood instead to the entire network.'}

Each user needs to store a m-1-polynomial having degree k as a private share. A secret conference key involving m users can be computed by each conference member non-interactively using each private share. There is no overhead to exchange information in order to establish a conference key. However, the storage space of each user is exponentially proportional to the group size of the conference. In this paper, we propose a key establishment protocol using a multivariate polynomial in ZN, where N is a RSA modulus. One unique feature of using this special type of polynomials for conference key protocol is that the storage space of each user is fixed and is independent to the group size of the conference. User can use their shares obtained from a key generation center initially to establish conference keys consisting of different users. Furthermore, we propose two applications to demonstrate the importance of using this special type of polynomials to design solutions. One is the private reconstruction of secret in a secret sharing scheme over network, and the other is the secure group communication. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.'}

Due to privacy issues, many strategic places remain unmonitored leading to security threats. The main problem with existing privacy protection methods is that they assume availability of accurate region of interest (RoI) detectors that can detect and hide the privacy sensitive regions such as faces. However, the current detectors are not fully reliable, leading to breaches in privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a privacy protection method that adopts adaptive data transformation involving the use of selective obfuscation and global operations to provide robust privacy even with unreliable detectors. Further, there are many implicit privacy leakage channels that have not been considered by researchers for privacy protection. We block both implicit and explicit channels of privacy leakage. Experimental results show that the proposed method incurs 38% less distortion of the information needed for surveillance in comparison to earlier methods of global transformation; while still providing near-zero privacy loss.'}

A method commonly used for segmentation is "background subtraction" or thresholding the difference between the estimated background image and current image. Adaptive Gaussian mixture based background modelling has been proposed by many researchers for increasing the robustness against environmental changes. However, all these methods, being computationally intensive, need to be optimized for efficient and real-time performance especially at a higher image resolution. In this paper, we propose an improved foreground/background segmentation method which uses Experiential Sampling technique to restrict the computational efforts in the region of interest. We exploit the fact that the region of interest in general is present only in a small part of the image, therefore, the attention should only be focused in those regions. The proposed method shows a significant gain in processing speed at the expense of minor loss in accuracy. We provide experimental results and detailed analysis to show the utility of our method.'}

The basic idea is to approximate the articulated 3D shape of the human body using a subdivision into textured billboards along the skeleton structure. Billboards are clustered to fans such that each skeleton bone contains one billboard per source camera. We call this representation articulated billboards. In the paper we describe a semi-automatic, data-driven algorithm to construct and render this representation, which robustly handles even challenging acquisition scenarios characterized by sparse camera positioning, inaccurate camera calibration, low video resolution, or occlusions in the scene. First, for each input view, a 2D pose estimation based on image silhouettes, motion capture data, and temporal video coherence is used to create a segmentation mask for each body part. Then, from the 2D poses and the segmentation, the actual articulated billboard model is constructed by a 3D joint optimization and compensation for camera calibration errors. The rendering method includes a novel way of blending the textural contributions of each billboard and features an adaptive seam correction to eliminate visible discontinuities between adjacent billboards textures. Our articulated billboards do not only minimize ghosting artifacts known from conventional billboard rendering, but also alleviate restrictions to the setup and sensitivities to errors of more complex 3D representations and multi-view reconstruction techniques. Our results demonstrate the flexibility and the robustness of our approach with high quality free-viewpoint video generated from broadcast footage of challenging, uncontrolled environments.'}

One of the approach to acquire accurate shape is a projector-camera system, especially the methods that reconstructs a shape by using a single image with static pattern is suitable for capturing fast moving object. In this paper, we propose a method that uses a grid pattern consisting of sets of parallel lines. The pattern is spatially encoded by a periodic color pattern. While informations are sparse in the camera image, the proposed method extracts the dense (pixel-wise) phase informations from the sparse pattern. As the result, continuous regions in the camera images can be extracted by analyzing the phase. Since there remain one DOF for each region, we propose the linear solution to eliminate the DOF by using geometric informations of the devices, i.e. epipolar constraint. In addition, solution space is finite because projected pattern consists of parallel lines with same intervals, the linear equation can be efficiently solved by integer least square method. In this paper, the formulations for both single and multiple projectors are presented. We evaluated the accuracy of correspondences and showed the comparison with respect to the number of projectors by simulation. Finally, the dense 3D reconstruction of moving objects are presented in the experiments.'}

We are developing a system to measure the shapes and sizes of living tissue by active stereo method using a normal endoscope on which a micro pattern projector is attached. In order to perform 3D reconstruction, estimating the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the endoscopic camera and the pattern projector is required. Particularly, calibration of the pattern projector is difficult. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous estimation method of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the pattern projector. This simplifies the calibration procedure required in practical scenes. Furthermore, we have developed an efficient user interface to intuitively operate the calibration and reconstruction procedures. Using the developed system, we measured the shape of an internal tissue of the soft palate of a human and a biological specimen.'}

Analyzing large volume of patent data can uncover the potential competitive or collaborative relations among companies in certain areas, which can provide valuable information to develop strategies for intellectual property (IP), R&D, and marketing. In this paper, we present a novel topic-driven patent analysis and mining system. Instead of merely searching over patent content, we focus on studying the heterogeneous patent network derived from the patent database, which is represented by several types of objects (companies, inventors, and technical content) jointly evolving over time. We design and implement a general topic-driven framework for analyzing and mining the heterogeneous patent network. Specifically, we propose a dynamic probabilistic model to characterize the topical evolution of these objects within the patent network. Based on this modeling framework, we derive several patent analytics tools that can be directly used for IP and R&D strategy planning, including a heterogeneous network co-ranking method, a topic-level competitor evolution analysis algorithm, and a method to summarize the search results. We evaluate the proposed methods on a real-world patent database. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques clearly outperform the corresponding baseline methods."}

To cope with information overload, online news media publishes timelines for continuously developing news topics. However, the timeline summary does not show the relationship of storylines, and is not intuitive for readers to comprehend the development of a complex news topic. In this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring the interactions of storylines in a news topic. An interaction of two storylines is signified by informative news events that play a key role in both storylines. Storyline interactions can indicate key phases of a news topic, and reveal the latent connections among various aspects of the story. We address the coherence between news articles which is not considered in traditional similarity-based methods, and discover salient storyline interactions to form a clear, global picture of the news topic. User preference can be naturally integrated into our method to generate query-specific results. Comprehensive experiments on ten news topics show the effectiveness of our method over alternative approaches.'}

In the bioscience field, biological structures and terminologies are described by a large number of features; domain dependent features would significantly improve the classification performance. How to effectively select and integrate different types of features to improve the biological literature classification performance is the major issue studied in this paper.To efficiently classify the biological literatures, we propose a novel feature value schema TF*ML, features covering from lower level domain independent "string feature" to higher level domain dependent "semantic template feature", and proper integrations among the features. Compared to our previous approaches, the performance is improved in terms of AUC and F-Score by 11.5% and 8.8% respectively, and outperforms the best performance achieved in BioCreAtIvE 2006.Different types of features possess different discriminative capabilities in literature classification; proper integration of domain independent and dependent features would significantly improve the performance and overcome the over-fitting on data distribution.'}

This is especially true when consumers wish to compare two products, both of which are not negative. Previous work has addressed this problem by extracting various features from the review text for learning a predictor. Since the same word may have different sentiment effects when used by different reviewers on different products, we argue that it is necessary to model such reviewer and product dependent effects in order to predict review ratings more accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to incorporate reviewer and product information into the text based learner for rating prediction. The reviewer, product and text features are modeled as a three-dimension tensor. Tensor factorization techniques can then be employed to reduce the data sparsity problems. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which has a significant improvement compared to state of the art methods, especially for reviews with unpopular products and inactive reviewers.'}

Indeed, evolutionary approaches have mainly assumed that neural learning is associated with the adjustment of synaptic weights. The goal of this paper is to use evolutionary approaches to find suitable computational functions that are analogous to natural sub-components of biological neurons and demonstrate that intelligent behavior can be produced as a result of this additional biological plausibility. Our model allows neurons, dendrites, and axon branches to grow or die so that synaptic morphology can change and affect information processing while solving a computational problem. The compartmental model of a neuron consists of a collection of seven chromosomes encoding distinct computational functions inside the neuron. Since the equivalent computational functions of neural components are very complex and in some cases unknown, we have used a form of genetic programming known as Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) to obtain these functions. We start with a small random network of soma, dendrites, and neurites that develops during problem solving by repeatedly executing the seven chromosomal programs that have been found by evolution. We have evaluated the learning potential of this system in the context of a well-known single agent learning problem, known as Wumpus World. We also examined the harder problem of learning in a competitive environment for two antagonistic agents, in which both agents are controlled by independent CGP computational networks (CGPCN). Our results show that the agents exhibit interesting learning capabilities.'}

Yet, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have represented neurons as simple computational devices. It has been evident for a long time that ANNs have learning abilities that are insignificant compared with some of the simplest biological brains. We argue that we understand enough neuroscience to create much more sophisticated models. In this paper, we report on our attempts to do this.We identify and evolve seven programs that together represents a neuron which grows post evolution into a complete 'neurological' system. The network that occurs by running the programs has a highly dynamic morphology in which neurons grow, and die, and neurite branches together with synaptic connections form and change. We have evaluated the capability of these networks for playing the game of checkers. Our method has no board evaluation function, no explicit learning rules and no human expertise at playing checkers is used. The learning abilities of these networks are encoded at a genetic level rather than at the phenotype level of neural connections."}

Specifically, we show that a CCA-secure PKE scheme can be generically obtained by encrypting (m ||r ) under identity "f (r )" with the encryption algorithm of the given IBE scheme, assuming that the IBE scheme is non-malleable and f is one-way. In contrast to the previous generic methods (such as Canetti-Halevi-Katz), our method requires stronger security for the underlying IBE schemes, non-malleability, and thus cannot be seen as a direct improvement of the previous methods. However, once we have an IBE scheme which is proved (or can be assumed) to be non-malleable, we will have a PKE scheme via our simple method, and we believe that the simpleness of our proposed transformation itself is theoretically interesting. Our proof technique for security of the proposed scheme is also novel. In the security proof, we show how to deal with certain types of decryption queries which cannot be handled by straightforwardly using conventional techniques.'}

Though there are several concrete constructions of TRE-PC proposed so far, no generic construction has been known. In this paper, we show a generic construciton of TRE-PC. Specifically, we construct a TRE-PC scheme from a chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption scheme (PKE), a chosen plaintext secure identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme with specific property that we call target collision resistance for randomness , and a one-time signature scheme. Interestingly, our proposed construction of TRE-PC is essentially the same as the generic construciton of (normal) TRE based on multiple encryption of IBE and PKE. As one of the consequences of our result, we can build a TRE-PC scheme secure in the standard model based on weaker assumptions than the ones used by the existing standard model TRE-PC scheme.'}

In order to solve this problem, we focus on utility-based routing schemes, where for a message, utility of a node indicates its proximity to the destination node of the message. Utility-based routing schemes are promising when relay nodes, i.e., nodes with the message (copy), have sufficient opportunities to encounter other nodes. On the other hand, when relay nodes are in extremely sparse areas of nodes and they have few opportunities to encounter other nodes, the routing schemes do not work effectively. This observation naturally leads us to propose a location-aware utility-based routing scheme. The proposed scheme combines a utility-based routing scheme with location-aware probabilistic forwarding, where the forwarding probability is determined based on both node utility and node density at the contact location. With several simulation scenarios, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of the mean number of copies in the network and the mean message delivery delay.'}

To do so, each node estimates a node density distribution based on information about contact locations. In this paper, we clarify how the estimation accuracy affects the performance of LA Routing. We also examine the performance of LA Routing when it applies to networks with homogeneous node density. Through simulation experiments, we show that LA Routing is fairly robust against the accuracy of node density estimation and its performance is comparable with Probabilistic Routing even in the case that that node density is homogeneous.'}

Attacks may hijack victim's address space to disrupt network services or perpetrate malicious activities such as spamming and DoS attacks without disclosing identity. We propose novel ways to significantly improve the detection accuracy by combining analysis of passively collected BGP routing updates with data plane ingerprints of suspicious prefixes. The key insight is to use data plane information in the form of edge network ingerprinting to disambiguate suspect IP hijacking incidences based on routing anomaly detection. Conflicts in data plane ingerprints provide much more definitive evidence of successful IP pre- fix hijacking. Utilizing multiple real-time BGP feeds, we demonstrate the ability of our system to distinguish between legitimate routing changes and actual attacks. Strong correlation with addresses that originate spam emails from a spam honeypot confirms the accuracy of our techniques."}

This importance is illustrated by past work on understanding the delay constancy of Internet paths and recent work on predicting network delays using virtual coordinate systems. Merely understanding currently observed delays is insufficient, as network performance can degrade not only due to traffic variability but also as a result of routing changes. Unfortunately this latter effect so far has been ignored in understanding and predicting delay related performance metrics of Internet paths. Our work is the first to address this short coming by systematically analyzing changes in network delays and jitter of a diverse and comprehensive set of Internet paths. Using empirical measurements, we illustrate that routing changes can result in roundtrip delay increase of converged paths by more than 1 second. Surprisingly, intradomain routing changes can also cause such large delay increase. Given these observations, we develop a framework to analyze in detail the impact of routing changes on network delays between end-hosts. Using topology information and properties associated with routing changes, we explain the causes for observed delay fluctuations and more importantly identify routing changes that lead to predictable effects on delay-related metrics. Using our framework, we study the predictability of delay and jitter changes in response to both passively observed interdomain and actively measured intradomain routing changes.'}

It is happening in the world of computing, and is poised to happen in networking. While many have considered this in the context of network virtualization, they all focus on one model - overlaying a virtual network of multiple virtual routers on top of a shared physical infrastructure, each completely isolated from the others through the use of virtualization. In this paper we argue for a different approach, where those running the service are presented with the abstraction of a single router in order to enable them to focus solely on their service rather than worrying about managing a virtual network as well. We discuss the abstraction of a single router, and the challenges of mapping the collection of abstract routers (from different parties) to the distributed and shared physical infrastructure.'}

Live virtual machine (VM) migration is becoming an indispensable management tool in such environments. However, VMs often have a tight coupling with the underlying network. Hence, cloud providers are beginning to offer tenants more control over their virtual networks. Seamless migration of all (or part) of a virtual network greatly simplifies management tasks like planned maintenance, optimizing resource usage, and cloud bursting. Our LIME architecture efficiently migrates an ensemble, a collection of virtual machines and virtual switches, for any arbitrary controller and end-host applications. To minimize performance disruptions, during the migration, LIME temporarily runs all or part of a virtual switch on multiple physical switches. Running a virtual switch on multiple physical switches must be done carefully to avoid compromising application correctness. To that end, LIME merges events, combines traffic statistics, and preserves consistency among multiple physical switches even across changes to the packet-handling rules. Using a formal model, we prove that migration under LIME is transparent to applications, i.e., any execution of the controller and end-host applications during migration is a completely valid execution that could have taken place in a migration-free setting. Experiments with our prototype, built on the Floodlight controller, show that ensemble migration can be an efficient tool for network management.'}

4199	419919	Robust traffic matrix estimation with imperfect information: making use of multiple data sources	{'title': 'Robust traffic matrix estimation with imperfect information: making use of multiple data sources', 'text': 'Estimation of traffic matrices, which provide critical input for network capacity planning and traffic engineering, has recently been recognized as an important research problem. Most of the previous approaches infer traffic matrix from either SNMP link loads or sampled NetFlow records. In this work, we design novel inference techniques that, by statistically correlating SNMP link loads and sampled NetFlow records, allow for much more accurate estimation of traffic matrices than obtainable from either information source alone, even when sampled NetFlow records are available at only a subset of ingress. Our techniques are practically important and useful since both SNMP and NetFlow are now widely supported by vendors and deployed in most of the operational IP networks. More importantly, this research leads us to a new insight that SNMP link loads and sampled NetFlow records can serve as "error correction codes" to each other. This insight helps us to solve a challenging open problem in traffic matrix estimation, "How to deal with dirty data (SNMP and NetFlow measurement errors due to hardware/software/transmission problems)?" We design techniques that, by comparing notes between the above two information sources, identify and remove dirty data, and therefore allow for accurate estimation of the traffic matrices with the cleaned dat.We conducted experiments on real measurement data obtained from a large tier-1 ISP backbone network. We show that, when full deployment of NetFlow is not available, our algorithm can improve estimation accuracy significantly even with a small fraction of NetFlow data. More importantly, we show that dirty data can contaminate a traffic matrix, and identifying and removing them can reduce errors in traffic matrix estimation by up to an order of magnitude. Routing changes is another a key factor that affects estimation accuracy. We show that using them as the a priori, the traffic matrices can be estimated much more accurately than those omitting the routing change. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to offer a comprehensive solution which fully takes advantage of using multiple readily available data sources. Our results provide valuable insights on the effectiveness of combining flow measurement and link load measurement.'}
